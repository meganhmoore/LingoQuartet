       " 'article_text': 'President Trump’s Washington, D.C., hotel made at least $2 million less than projected in its first two months of operation, according to House Democrats citing documents obtained from the General Services Administration (GSA).Democrats on the House Oversight and Transportation committees revealed the information in a letter sent Monday to GSA Administrator Timothy Horne, in which they asked how the agency planned to handle the alleged breach of the lease on the hotel housed in the Old Post Office, just east of the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.A provision in the lease, signed years before Trump began his presidential campaign, prevents any federal elected official from being included on or benefiting from the lease. The Democrats claim in their letter that Trump’s ascendance to the presidency on Friday is a breach of the lease.The documents Democrats obtained from the GSA and released Monday show that Trump has a 76.7 percent stake in the hotel.\\xa0The hotel has been a constant source of criticism from Democrats and ethics officials who warn it could be used by foreign governments and businesses to curry favor with the president. Adding to the focus Monday was a lawsuit filed by the left-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington “to stop President Trump from violating the Constitution by illegally receiving payments from foreign governments.”{mosads}“Our hope has always been that President Trump would resolve these breach-of-lease and conflict of interest issues prior to being sworn in as President on January 20,” the Democrats wrote in their Monday letter.“Unfortunately, President Trump has refused to address these concerns, and taxpayer dollars may now be squandered as career public servants are forced to take remedial action to cure this breach.”The letter also includes the Trump hotel’s revenue versus estimates from September and October 2016, its first two months of operation.The Trump hotel made $1,301,000 in revenue in September, though it was projected to make $2,087,000 — meaning it faced a roughly $700,000 shortfall. The hotel made $2,771,000 in revenue in October, compared to a projected $4,276,000. That’s nearly $2.3 million less than projected in total.The hotel’s net loss for September was $334,000 and $825,000 in October. It was estimated to lose $84,000 in September and gain $481,000 in profit in October.“The possibility that President Trump will profit from large increases in hotel revenues because he was elected President highlights the grave concerns we have raised for months about his conflicts of interest and potential violations of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution,” wrote the Democrats, citing a clause in the Constitution barring elected officials from receiving gifts or payments from foreign governments.The Democrats asked Horne if the agency would be notifying Trump that he violated his lease, and questioned how the GSA plans to deal with the alleged breach and how it would handle claims that the Trump Organization failed to pay contractors who worked on the hotel.The Democrats also asked for copies of correspondence between the GSA and the Trump Organization and transition team.',\n",

       "  'full_article_text': 'President Trump on Monday said he was “proud” of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s handling of the economic turmoil brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, backing down from more than a year of criticizing his hand-picked Fed chief and threatening his job security.Trump praised Powell during a Monday evening briefing at the White House after the Fed that morning drastically expanded its efforts to protect the U.S. economy and financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.“I really think he’s caught up and he’s done the right thing, and I think, ultimately, we will be rewarded because of the decision he made,” Trump said.\\xa0“He’s really stepped up over the last week,”\\xa0the president continued, adding that he called the Fed chairman to say, “Jerome, you’ve done a really good job.”A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.The Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced Monday it would purchase an unlimited number\\xa0of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to bolster the economy as businesses across the country shutter.\\xa0While Powell chairs the FOMC, he doesn’t not make these decisions alone and must win support from other FOMC members. The Fed’s Monday actions were approved unanimously by the FOMC.The Fed will also roll out new facilities to purchase corporate and consumer debt and a program to offer loans to small and medium-sized businesses.The Fed’s actions were the latest and most drastic steps down an unprecedented path of intervention in the U.S. economy and financial system amid the deadly pandemic. The central bank has also zeroed out its baseline interest rate range and has offered trillions of dollars in short-term loans to banks to help keep credit flowing to households and businesses.“I was proud of him. That took courage, and, ultimately, you’re going to see the fruits,” Trump said. “Now, he’s not finished. I mean, he’s got other arrows in the quiver or whatever they say. I will tell you he’s got plenty of arrows, but, no, I’m very happy with the job he did.”Trump’s praise for Powell marks a breakthrough in the president’s attitude toward the Fed and its chairman, whom\\xa0he\\xa0nominated to the job in October 2017.Trump had blasted the Fed throughout 2018 and the start of 2019 for raising interest rates while the economy set 50-year lows in unemployment and enjoyed solid growth. The president then called on the Fed to slash interest rates to 0 percent to match\\xa0those of less prosperous nations abroad despite the relative strength of the U.S. economy.Economists had fiercely criticized Trump for pressuring the Fed into crisis-era stimulus while the economy remained strong and have largely been supportive of the Fed’s aggressive steps to staunch job losses and bankruptcies.\\xa0Updated at 8:43 p.m.'},\n",

Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s Quds Force, in a drone strike in Baghdad. Both a current administration official and a former senior official told CNN that Iran-Taliban ties were cited as part of the justification for the strike against\\xa0Soleimani.In March 2020, the Defense Department reportedly made the decision not to take any specific action in response to the intelligence\\xa0to avoid complicating peace talks with the Taliban. National Security Council officials recommended against a\\xa0strike and also said the escalating coronavirus pandemic would likely limit the Afghan government’s options for a diplomatic response, according to the network.The briefing document stated that the Bagram attack likely qualified for compensation from the foreign government “based on the nature of the attack and agreed upon bounties.” Although U.S. intelligence said the Haqqani network had reason to target the base without a financial motivator, CNN noted that the document states the alleged funding “probably incentivizes future high-profile attacks on US and Coalition forces.”Pentagon spokesman Army Maj. Rob Lodewick told CNN that “the Department of Defense does not disclose timelines or discussions surrounding internal deliberations and intelligence briefings.”However, he said, “the administration has repeatedly demanded, both publicly and privately, that Iran cease its scourge of malign and destabilizing behavior throughout the Middle East and the world. While the United States, its NATO allies and coalition partners are working to facilitate an end to 19 years of bloodshed, Iran’s inimical influence seeks to undermine the Afghan peace process and foster a continuation of violence and instability.”The report comes soon after reports of similar bounties offered by Russia, which the Kremlin has denied.The Hill has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.\\xa0'},\n",

It’s taken forever. However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace,” Trump said in a video posted to Twitter.“Despite all of this wasteful spending and much more, the $900 billion package provides hardworking taxpayers with only $600 each in relief payments, and not enough money is given to small businesses, and in particular restaurants, whose owners have suffered so grievously,” he added.The bill includes special terms for restaurants and hotels to access larger loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, a move praised by the National Restaurant Association. It\\xa0does not include the Restaurants Act, a bill the restaurant industry had pushed for earlier that would have set aside $120 billion in funds for restaurants or bars with fewer than 20 locations.pic.twitter.com/v9Rdjz6DNu— Donald J.

He also falsely claimed that the bill provided more stimulus funds for noncitizens than citizens.The COVID-19 relief bill prevented undocumented\\xa0immigrants from receiving stimulus checks but did allow mixed-status households to receive the checks. In such households, only the citizen adult and the children would receive funds.Trump did not explicitly threaten to veto the package, which passed both chambers with overwhelming, veto-proof majorities. If he vetoes or opts not to sign the bill by Monday at midnight, the government will shut down and several key unemployment benefits will expire.The federal government is currently funded through Dec. 28 as part of a stopgap bill.\\xa0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who spent months pushing for a larger COVID-19 relief bill in the face of GOP\\xa0opposition,\\xa0quickly responded to the tweet, saying she was in full support of increasing the size of the stimulus\\xa0checks.\\xa0“Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks. At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 — Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!” Pelosi tweeted.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a top Trump ally in Congress, urged the president on Tuesday night to quickly sign the COVID-19 relief bill, even if it is imperfect.“The #COVID19 package, while imperfect, will save jobs and lives. The sooner the bill becomes law – the better,” he wrote on Twitter.Trump, who was largely absent from negotiations over the COVID-19 bill in the aftermath of his election loss, reportedly planned to issue a similar statement calling for larger checks as talks neared their end last week, according to The Washington Post.Congressional Republicans, who insisted that the relief bill remain under $1 trillion, reportedly talked him out of the idea, warning that it would blow up the talks as they neared their deadline.Trump instead Tweeted out that “stimulus talks [are] looking very good.”Trump’s request comes after Congress has already left town for the Christmas holiday. The Senate is due to return on\\xa0Dec. 29, a day after government funding is set to expire, in order to override a possible veto on another bill with strong bipartisan backing: the National Defense Authorization Act.The key defense legislation has passed and been signed into law every year for the last 59 years.Trump released the video Tuesday night calling on Congress to send him a new bill\\xa0as his administration announced that\\xa0he\\xa0had granted clemency to three former GOP congressmen along with two people charged as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Those granted a pardon included George Papadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser to\\xa0Trump’s campaign in 2016 and pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators as part of Mueller’s Russia probe; former GOP Rep.

The truth is that I have suffered long bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that,” Osaka wrote.She also addressed her decision not to speak with the media at the tournament, writing that she gets “huge waves of anxiety” before speaking to the press.“Though the tennis press has always been kind to me (and I wanna apologize especially to all the cool journalists who I may have hurt), I am not a natural public speaker and get huge waves of anxiety before I speak to the world’s media,” Osaka wrote. “I get really nervous and find it stressful to always try to engage and give you the best answers I can.”She said she announced this decision preemptively because “the rules are quite outdated in parts” and she wanted to “highlight that.”“I wrote privately to the tournament apologizing and saying that I would be more than happy to speak with them after the tournament as the Slams are intense,” Osaka continued.She said “when the time is right” she wants to “work with the Tour to discuss ways we can make things better for the players, press and fans.”In a statement to The Hill, the president of the French Tennis Federation (FFT) said the group is “sorry and sad” for Osaka, adding that the outcome of her withdrawal was “unfortunate.”He also said the federation remains “very committed” to athletes’ wellbeing and “continually improving” aspects of the player experience, including with the media.“First and foremost, we are sorry and sad for Naomi Osaka. The outcome of Naomi withdrawing from Roland-Garros is unfortunate. We wish her the best and quickest possible recovery, and we look forward to having Naomi at our Tournament next year,” FFT President Gilles Moretton said in a statement.“As all the Grand Slams, the WTA, the ATP and the ITF, we remain very committed to all athletes’ wellbeing and to continually improving every aspect of players’ experience in our Tournament, including with the Media, like we have always strived to do,” he added.'},\n",

(RELATED: FBI Refuses To Disclose Documents Regarding Agency’s Targeting Of Catholics)“[T]he parties do not dispute that Roncalli and the Archdiocese had a non-pretextual religious policy against employees entering into same-sex marriages and that Fitzgerald was terminated because she did so,” Young wrote. “As such, Fitzgerald’s Title VII claims would be barred by the religious employer exemption.”BREAKING: A federal appeals court just ruled that Catholic schools are free to choose leaders who will uphold church teachings. This victory is the latest in a series of court rulings that protect religious groups from government interference. https://t.co/mUeGvE06xQ— Luke Goodrich (@LukeWGoodrich) July 13, 2023 Fitzgerald argued in her lawsuit that her role at the school as its co-director of guidance was religious and granted her a religious exemption to the school’s ability to terminate her based on faith. The appeals court agreed that Fitzgerald’s role was religious in nature but ruled that her admittance of this fact did not help her case because it proved that she violated the religion she actively worked to promote.Fitzgerald also said in her lawsuit that she exaggerated her involvement in some religious duties because she knew it would help her get a raise. Young argued that this further weakened her claim.“Even if we accept that she exaggerated on her evaluation and did not actually perform these religious duties, the fact that she mentioned these activities in her self-evaluation to get a raise supports that she understood these criteria to be important to the school,” Young said in the decision. “As the defendants persuasively explain, ‘the very fact that she would exaggerate about performing religious tasks to get a raise only underscores that it was Roncalli’s expectation that she perform them.'”Joseph Davis, counsel at Becket, said in a press release that religious schools must be able to hire employees that will help pass their faith on to students.“Religious\\xa0schools exist to\\xa0pass on the faith to\\xa0the next generation\\xa0and to do that,\\xa0they need the freedom to choose\\xa0leaders\\xa0who are fully committed to their religious mission,” Davis said. “The precedent keeps piling up:\\xa0Catholic schools can ask Catholic school teachers and administrators\\xa0to be fully supportive of Catholic teaching.”\\xa0Fitzgerald’s attorney did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tim Walz in May on behalf of parents, Mark and Melinda Loe, and two colleges after the state changed its Postsecondary Enrollment Options program (PSEO), prohibiting state funding to be used to attend universities requiring a statement of faith. Several weeks later, Ellison agreed to a preliminary injunction that would allow religious students to use the funding for the college of their choice while the lawsuit goes through the courts, according to the press release. (RELATED: Catholic Parents Sue State Officials For Dismissing Supreme Court Decision Granting Religious Schools Tuition Funding)“We are glad that Minnesota has agreed not to punish our children and many students like them for wanting to learn at schools that reflect their values,” the Loes said in the press release. “They should be able to pursue the same great opportunities as all other students in the state without politicians in St. Paul getting in the way. We hope the court will eventually strike this law down for good and protect all religious students and the schools they want to attend.”BREAKING: We sued and Minnesota backed down! Just weeks after passing a law that targeted religious schools that asked their students to sign a statement of faith, Minnesota agreed to a court order tying its hands from enforcing the law while our lawsuit is pending.— Eric Baxter (@esbax) June 14, 2023 Minnesota’s PSEO program allows 10th through 12th-grade students to “earn college credit tuition free while still in high school, through enrollment in and successful completion of college courses” on a full or part-time basis, according to the state DOE’s website. In May 2023, Walz passed a $72 billion budget with a provision that amended the program to reject students who were looking to attend a college that required a statement of faith or based its admission process on a “student’s race, creed, ethnicity, disability, gender, or sexual orientation or religious beliefs or affiliations.”Becket filed the lawsuit a day later, arguing that the new rule was discriminatory and had been addressed in the Supreme Court decision in Carson v Makin in 2022 when the justices ruled that Maine’s law was a violation of the First Amendment. The law firm also filed a similar lawsuit in Maine Wednesday after the state changed its Human Rights Act to keep religious elementary and high schools from accessing state funding.Diana Thomson, senior counsel at Becket, said in the press release that the state was attempting to “walk back” its “anti-religious law.”“It’s not every day that a state asks a federal court to tie its hands to prevent it from enforcing its own anti-religious law—but Minnesota has done just that,” Thomson said. “As this effort to walk back demonstrates, the state didn’t do its homework before it passed this unconstitutional law. The next step is for the court to strike down this ban for good.”Walz, Becket and the DOE did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Makin, when the justices ruled that Maine’s “nonsectarian” requirement was a violation of the First Amendment.“States discriminating against religion have already struck out three times at the Supreme Court,” the lawsuit reads. “Minnesota should not get a fourth attempt.

The Daily Caller interviewed prominent detransitioners including Chloe Cole, Cat Cattinson, and Walt Heyer for a recent documentary “Damaged: The Transing of America’s Kids.” (RELATED: Watch “Damaged: The Transing of America’s Kids”)The New York Times ran a piece Tuesday dismissing the stories of individuals who regret getting transgender treatments as children, saying their experiences paled in comparison to the “objections from transgender people and medical experts.”Puberty blockers can cause bone development issues in children, potentially leading to an increased risk of fractures later in life. Cross-sex hormones can also affect a patient’s fertility, according to a handout from OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital. Some medical experts believe\\xa0the use of puberty blockers on young children may place children on a fast track towards receiving other sex change procedures, children who might otherwise desist.“Though many unhinged activists compromising the healthcare field think otherwise, children are not to be treated as science experiments,” Paxton continued in the letter. “Doctors and hospitals should not be pushing mutilative and irreversible ‘gender transitioning’ procedures that will negatively impact innocent children for the rest of their lives.”The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH), a leading medical organization which sets guidance for several hospitals, did away with all age restrictions in their recommendations for transgender operations for kids in 2022. WPATH also recognizes a “eunuch” gender identity, even as several European countries move away from offering transgender treatment to kids, calling them “experimental.” The American Medical Association (AMA), America’s medical licensing and lobbying group, has also issued statements calling on governors and states to “stop interfering in health care of transgender children.”SCOOP: @KenPaxtonTX has launched an investigation into the child sex-change program at Texas Children’s Hospital, which I exposed through whistleblower reporting on Tuesday.“Any ‘gender transitioning’ procedures that hurt our children constitute child abuse under Texas law.” pic.twitter.com/PdrWQLEvWh— Christopher F.

Kathy Hochul’s 2024 budget earlier this month, amending New York’s Concealed Carry Improvement Act (CCIA), which bans persons from carrying firearms inside places of worship, to exempt armed “persons responsible for security at such place(s) of worship.” Despite this, religious advocates and experts argue it does little to protect churches from rising hatred, pointing to vague language in the law that makes it unclear how churches can defend themselves. (RELATED: Jewish Man Attacked While Entering New York Synagogue Amid Spike In Antisemitic Hate Crimes)Tzvi Waldman, head of the NYS Jewish Gun Club, an organization that offers “security training for houses of worship,” told the DCNF that the changes to the law were not made with protecting his faith in mind.“They didn’t come in thinking, ‘What can we do to make the community safer, to make people safer,'” Waldman explained. “Because if they were they would have discussed it with us to try to figure out what we really need, and none of that happened.”A recent report from the Family Research Council found almost 70 churches have been attacked in the first three months of 2023. After the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court in June 2022, churches experienced a host of attacks, including vandalism, and arson and in several cases, church members were assaulted.Antisemitism has also been on the rise, according to recent FBI hate crime statistics, which showed there were 814 anti-Jewish incidents reported in 2021.Amy Swearer, a senior legal fellow in The Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, told the DCNF that the changes to New York’s law were “not near enough” and don’t take into account how religious communities operate.“This really doesn’t do a whole lot for many houses of worship,” Swearer said. “You have people inside those churches for various church programs or functions, daycares or pastors and secretaries and choir rehearsals. Those are all occurring throughout the week, and even if they can have armed private security, during you know, one or two hours on Sunday, that doesn’t take care of the rest of the week.”Swearer and Waldman also noted the dangers for religious members during their commute to their place of worship, since they would be forced to remain unarmed to enter the building, or alternatively, leave their weapons in their vehicle.“What if the church is in a very dangerous area and people can’t carry to and from church?” Swearer told the DCNF. “Now you have to keep your gun locked in your car, in the parking lot, and every criminal in the state of New York knows that’s where the guns are going to have to be kept.”WEST VALLEY CITY, UT – DECEMBER 27: A Utah teacher is shown how to handle a handgun by instructor Clint Simon at a concealed-weapons training class for 200 Utah teachers on December 27, 2012, in West Valley City, Utah.\\xa0 (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)New York’s ban has been the subject of controversy since the Supreme Court ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen in 2022 that the state’s citizens did not need to demonstrate a need to defend themselves to obtain a concealed carry license. Weeks later, the state passed the CCIA, which, among other things, banned individuals from carrying firearms in “sensitive locations,” including houses of worship with the exception of private security.In the changes adopted through the governor’s 2024 budget, the term “security guard” is defined as individuals “who have been granted a special armed registration card, while at the location of their employment and during their work hours as such a security guard.”Swearer told the DCNF that Hochul’s changes to the CCIA are “vague” and don’t give religious communities clear guidelines to work with.“[I]t’s kind of vague as to whether that can just be a concealed carry permit holder who is assigned to a security team or whether it has to be a licensed, paid security officer,” Swearer said.However, the law’s defenders argue the restrictions are necessary to reduce gun violence.“While some Justices on the Supreme Court appear unconcerned about the gun violence epidemic raging across the United States, fortunately New York’s political leaders recognize their duty to protect families and communities, and realize that the Constitution allows states to enact gun violence prevention laws to protect their residents,” Jonathan Lowy, chief counsel of gun control advocacy group Brady, said following CCIA’s passage.Hochul defended the CCIA after the Supreme Court ruled that the law must remain intact during the ongoing lawsuits, calling it “an important and appropriate step.”Waldman’s organization was one of several that filed a lawsuit against the CCIA due to concerns about its restrictions on religious communities, arguing that churches should not be exempt from Second Amendment protection.First Liberty Institute (FLI) filed a lawsuit on behalf of His Tabernacle Family Church in New York in 2022 against the CCIA. FLI Senior Counsel Jeremy Dys told the DCNF that he believed the recent changes were only made in an attempt to halt any legal repercussions.“The state of New York is having a hard time right now [balancing] constitutional issues and realizing that the First and Second Amendments are an appropriate [barrier] to state actors who wish to silence people of faith, and especially people of faith who would also exercise their Second Amendment rights,” Dys said. “I suspect the state of New York is now realizing that they moved way too fast and are kind of stuck. They made promises to their constituents, that the Constitution cannot allow them to follow through on, and that’s a good thing.”Hochul did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In response, more Jews have begun exercising their rights under the Second Amendment to protect themselves and their communities, according to experts that spoke with the DCNF. (RELATED: Jewish Reporter Files Lawsuit After Allegedly Getting Kicked Out Of A Bar For Being A ‘Zionist Fascist’)“I entered the [gun] industry about six years ago, and at the time, I was kind of disheartened to see that Jews didn’t have representation in the Second Amendment world,” Yehuda Remer, founder of The Pew Pew Jew, a Jewish gun rights advocacy organization located in Texas, told the DCNF. “In the last six and a half years, I have seen, unfortunately, and fortunately, a massive uptick in Jews going out and getting guns … and starting to be a lot more vocal about how important the Second Amendment is. I think a lot of these people never would have picked up a gun, or even given it a second thought, if it wasn’t for the rise in antisemitism.”Rabbi Yossi Elifort, the founder of Magen Am USA, a non-profit organization that helps create armed security teams within the Jewish community, also noted the increasing amount of interest in self-defense in the Jewish community.“I probably trained 300 first-time shooters in the last two years,” Elifort said. “So there are a lot of first-timers coming out. What’s interesting about American Second Amendment culture is that I found the people who own guns for longer and grew up shooting tend to be less interested or concerned [about] training and those that are getting into it now are more open to it.”A man stands next to a new memorial made of the original entrance door inside the synagogue in Halle, eastern Germany, on October 09, 2020, on the first anniversary of the anti-Semitic attack on the synagogue.

Remer said that Jews have traditionally been silent about the hate directed at them, but as the incidents have escalated, from swastikas spray-painted on synagogues to muggings and shootings while walking down the street, there has been a greater push to learn how to defend themselves.Raziel Cohen, also known as the Tactical Rabbi, and founder of the National Defensive Firearms Training Academy, told the DCNF that many of the people they’ve helped train in recent years had never even held a firearm.“A big portion of what we’re dealing with is people who have never touched a firearm before,” Cohen said. “So there’s definitely a different level of training that goes into teaching a beginner so that they are confident and safe, especially since owning a firearm, in general, is obviously a very serious responsibility. There is a large amount of people who have never been involved but either had an attack happen to them or came to the understanding that it’s very possible and that’s why they’re now making the decision to go forward with it.”Remer and Cohen noted that the number of Jewish women looking to learn how to shoot has also heavily increased. Cohen explained that women are typically more serious about training because the risk to females at home, or walking down the street, is much greater than to men.Jewish synagogues have also experienced an increasing level of violence. In December, a man was arrested in Michigan after threatening a Jewish synagogue and preschool, and then, in February, another man walked into a San Francisco synagogue, firing blank rounds into the ceiling, during a small gathering.Tzvi Waldman, who heads the NYS Jewish Gun Club in New York, told the DCNF that part of the reason Jews are at risk is because of laws that prevent them from carrying guns in houses of worship. Waldman said that many synagogues can’t afford expensive private security, but they have little choice when states like New York ban guns in places of worship.“We shouldn’t have to rely on a third party nor the government,” Waldman said. “I mean the First Amendment, it’s our right to free speech, [but] I don’t have to hire a press secretary to talk and I’m allowed to get on social media, or just stand in front of my house with a microphone and say whatever I want to say. The more effective way, and the way of constitutional law, is to have [trained] citizens within the community to be there, just in case, … [but] you’re not allowed to do that under the current law.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Conservative Justice Remains ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ Ahead Of Wisconsin Supreme Court Election)“It’s not scandalous when partisan operatives and PACs work to boost their party’s candidates and hurt the other party’s candidates. But it is scandalous when those partisans pretend to be ‘news’ sites,” Capital Research Center President Scott Walter told the DCNF. “This drives the public’s view of journalists even lower and poisons honest debate.”AIM, which does not seem to have its own website, has run “project” sites much like The Wisconsin Independent focused on news coverage in several other states. In 2022, the organization paid more than $300,000 combined for ads promoting The Arizona Independent and The Georgia Independent content across Facebook and Instagram, while paying tens of thousands more to advertise articles published on The Pennsylvania Independent.Some of those advertised articles were critical of Republicans as well. One called Arizona Republicans “out of touch with abortion rights,” while another said the then-Republican-controlled Pennsylvania Assembly was prioritizing “corporate tax cuts over education or inflation” in its budget bill.The AIM trademark is owned by the Brock-founded company True Blue Media, which publishes the “progressive news” website The American Independent. In April 2022, AIM was registered at the same Washington, D.C. address listed in a 2020 court filing for the Brock-chaired Media Matters for America, his American Bridge 21st Century PAC and the American Bridge 21st Century Foundation he founded.Brock was once a conservative journalist, but he became a Clinton supporter as a result of writing a 1997 book about Hillary Clinton, he told Politico in 2015. In a Jan. 2021 New York Times opinion essay, he referenced how he founded the super PAC Correct The Record in 2015 to help elect Hillary Clinton president, saying, “Like most Democrats, I initially underestimated Donald Trump.”“Democratic donors have long overlooked efforts to fund the media, but with so much of our politics playing out on that battlefield, they can no longer afford to,” Brock wrote.Brock is tied to a 2022 print media campaign very similar to the AIM project sites. A print publication called “The Pennsylvania Independent” was sent to about 20% of the state’s households in April 2022, with “The Wisconsin Independent” and “The Michigan Independent” physically circulating as well, according to The Washington Post.“Independent women are not cable news junkies. They are on Facebook but they don’t trust it. The thing they trusted from the survey that we did was local print news,” Brock said, the outlet reported in October. “This is in the tradition of advocacy journalism. It is coming from a center-left point of view. We are trying to shed light on actors who are standing in the way of progress.”The American Bridge 21st Century Foundation, which has historically donated millions of dollars to the similarly-named PAC, gave True Blue Media more than $1.6 million in funding in 2017, more than $1 million in 2018, and $35,000 in 2019, with Brock owning more than 35% of the company in each of those years, IRS records indicated.Former The American Independent CEO Allison Girvin told the media credibility watchdog group NewsGuard in spring 2020 that Brock held “less than 30%” of True Blue Media ownership at that time, according to a document NewsGuard provided to the DCNF. Girvin said she did not think there was any plan for True Blue Media to keep receiving American Bridge 21st Century funding, “and if we do it would be negligible.”NewsGuard ruled that the “progressive news” organization The American Independent “does not gather and present information responsibly” because it fails to disclose American Bridge’s political affiliation “while covering news from a liberal perspective that supports the organization’s mission,” the document said.The American Independent features articles that accuse congressional Republicans of pursuing “extreme bills” that would “undermine labor rights” and “the climate and environment.” A significant portion of the website’s recent content comes from the The American Independent Foundation, which produced the two Facebook-advertised articles found on The Wisconsin Independent and many articles scattered across AIM’s other “project” sites.AIM’s Facebook and Instagram advertisements appeared on computer screens more than two million times combined. The Arizona Independent and The Ohio Independent do not appear to have published new articles since the November midterm elections, while the most recent content currently posted on The Georgia Independent was a late November American Independent Foundation article critical of then-Georgia Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker.The Wisconsin Independent, along with some other sites within the AIM network, also republished nonpolitical articles from outlets like The Associated Press.Brock serves as president of Facts First USA, which calls itself “a bipartisan organization focused on ensuring that our national discourse is grounded in facts and honest debate.”Facts First USA, Media Matters, the American Bridge 21st Century PAC and The American Independent did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(Photo by Cole Burston/Getty Images)The group goes on further to blame “anti-LGBTQ+ legislation” and “harmful rhetoric” from the church and American Christians for “discrimination and violence” against the transgender community, according to the statement.“As members of the body of Christ, we cannot be whole without the full inclusion of transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive individuals,” the statement reads. “At this moment in the United States, transgender people are experiencing harm and erasure.”The statement comes despite The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) releasing a statement a week earlier on March 21 warning against gender transition surgeries. The bishops argued that modern technology must not interfere with the “true flourishing of the human person” and that transgender medical procedures are not “morally justified.”Pope Francis made similar comments earlier this month saying that he believed gender ideology to be one of the “most dangerous ideological colonizations” because it “blurs differences and the value” of men and women.“The question of gender is diluting the differences and making the world the same, all dull, all alike, and that is contrary to the human vocation,” Francis said.SSJF, Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary of-the-Woods and Indiana and Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth JPIC office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Grow houses have taken over what used to be the central post office, and multi-acre weed farms are piping up beside peoples property.The city of 37,000 residents where the median household income is $40,000 is now home to\\xa047 licensed medical dispensaries and 78 grow operations, according to Politico.

Bryan Slaton had some “fun” with the federal government in February after introducing a House Committee Resolution that informed the federal government that all of the guns in many of Texas’s counties had been tragically lost in a series of alleged boating accidents.HCR 54, “respectfully” notified the federal government that the boating accidents, which allegedly took place in\\xa0Hunt, Hopkins, Van Zandt and “possibly other counties” in Texas, resulted in the loss of all firearms, accessories and ammunition owned by private gun owners, according to the resolution. The resolution further notified the Biden administration, and any further administration, that any attempt to “buyback, confiscate or register” the firearms, will not be possible or necessary.“There’s different ways to respond to federal overreach. And, you know, natural emotion, people get upset, angry, but at some point, my thoughts is, if they’re going to be disrespectful, maybe we should have fun with them,” Slaton told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “In a day and time where people can claim to be anything they want and don’t need facts, well okay, fine. We had a series of alleged boating accidents.”Slaton noted that “it would be incredibly insensitive during this time of mourning” for President Joe Biden to attempt to confiscate any firearms in Texas House District 2. (RELATED:\\xa0‘Zero Tolerance’: The Biden Admin Is Allegedly Shutting Down Gun Stores For Minor Clerical Errors)Slaton originally wrote the resolution two years ago, but decided to file it in February in response to the federal government’s “attitude toward things” and “disrespect” for the Bill of Rights, he told the DCNF. “I just have a problem with that. And so do a bunch of people in my district. And since this has made some headlines, apparently, there’s a lot of people around the country upset with the federal government and what they’re saying and doing towards the Second Amendment.”The recent attacks on the 2A by Joe Biden is more of the same tired rhetoric that we have seen from the radical Left for years.‘Shall not be infringed’ is written in plain English, and Texans will not stand for these violations of our rights.

So people were familiar with it and it wasn’t something totally out of the blue. I thought it would be a good way to push back.”Some attribute the statement to a 2014 incident in California where the waterline of Castaic Lake receded 151 feet to reveal a gun and badge of a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) agent, according to Pew Pew Tactical, a firearm-based news outlet. It is unknown if any disciplinary action was taken, but the ATF agent allegedly continued to work at the Bureau.After it was made known that the agent lost his gun and continued to work at the agency, the meme of losing firearms in a boating accident was born, according to Pew Pew Tactical. Gun owners took issue with the lack of consequences, especially since the alleged event took place in California, one of the most restrictive states for gun ownership.The next step in the process will be to see if the resolution is brought in front of the resolution committee, Slaton told the DCNF.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': \"Gun stores are closing at rapid rates after\\xa0the Biden administration implemented a “zero tolerance” policy for gun dealers and added updated language to define what can be classified as a “willful” violation, leaving Federal Firearm License (FFL) revocations at a 16-year high, according to Second Amendment advocacy group Gun Owners of America (GOA).The increase in FFL revocations is due, in part, to language and administrative changes within the ATF, as the prior guidance said that the ATF “may” revoke FFls while the new “zero tolerance” policy says that the ATF “will” revoke FFLs for initial violations. The increase in license revocations, 92 in 2022 alone, is also due to the updated procedure that the ATF follows, as they no longer always go through a multi-step process, often opting to pull licenses for a multitude of “willful” violations, according to a GOA fact sheet and leaked documents on the updated policy.\\xa0(RELATED:\\xa0The ATF’s Pistol Brace Final Rule Sets The Stage To Classify Legal Gun Owners As Criminals)“Back in the day there was a process that they would go through when they discover a mistake or an incorrect record, and it starts with a warning letter. They work with the FFL, and then on second inspection, if they find more mistakes, they’ll do a work conference and actually talk to the FFL. Then, if they still are uncompliant, after that they would do a license revocation hearing,” GOA\\xa0Director of Federal Affairs Aidan Johnston told the DCNF.Under the Biden administration’s new policy, the warning letter and conference safeguards are often circumvented, leaving the ATF to pull licenses on the first go-around, Johnston told the DCNF.“That’s not how regulatory agencies are supposed to work in the sector that they’re supposed to regulate. They are supposed to help the companies, they’re supposed to ensure compliance but they’re not supposed to punish and destroy an entire industry based on just political opposition or political distaste,” Johnston continued.The 2022 revocations were the highest since 2008, tripled 2021’s revocations and exceeded revocations from years when twice as many gun stores were inspected, according to the fact sheet. The ATF also issued another 136 warning\\xa0conferences, the steepest penalty inspectors can\\xa0recommend without\\xa0revocation.“The real problem is that under Biden the ATF can’t be trusted to not use the so-called zero tolerance policy to shut down legitimate gun stores. Biden is already illegally using the ATF to redefine what a firearm is without the authorization of Congress to implement his attack on the rights of gun owners,” gun rights advocacy group Second Amendment Foundation founder and Executive Vice President Alan Gottlieb told the DCNF.What’s better than GOA gaining access to private ATF documents? GOA LEAKING private ATF documents!In case you missed it, we blew the lid off the ATF’s new “zero tolerance” policy. pic.twitter.com/jTdFegJWqw— Gun Owners of America (@GunOwners) February 16, 2023 One store owner, J.C. Harrison, from Johnson City, Tennessee, received a letter from the ATF in April of 2022 notifying him that they had revoked his license, according to NBC affiliate WCYB 5. Harrison appealed the decision, but was denied, saying the action was an “attack on the Second Amendment through the back door.”Harrison claims that his “violations” were simply clerical errors, including failing to record when weapons were returned after being worked on, according to WCYB 5.“You’re supposed to do a background check if it exceeds 30 days. It came back good, but it came back 30 days and then the 31st day the customer came to pick the gun up,” Harrison said. The license revocation was “huge” for Harrison, as he was financially dependent on the license.“My wife and I, this was our sole income, and it’s not anymore,” he said.“ATF cannot revoke a federal firearms license for ‘clerical errors.’ A federal firearms license can only be revoked for willful violations of the Gun Control Act. The GCA does not define ‘willful,'” ATF Public Affairs Division Deputy Chief Erik Longnecker told the DCNF. “The federal courts, however, have held that a willful violation of the GCA’s regulations occurs when the federal firearms licensee commits the violation with an intentional disregard of a known legal duty or with plain indifference to their legal obligations.”Alongside an updated policy, the ATF also updated their guidelines as to what constitutes a “willful” violation in 2022, according to a leaked internal ATF guidance. The original guidelines designated “willful” mistakes as a continued pattern of mistakes left unaddressed, but the new guidelines are more open-ended for inspectors.“If you have a clear record, if you don’t make any mistakes for a long period of time, and then you make a first one, that first one is evidence that it was a willful violation, because you knew how to follow the law before and you must have chosen to not follow on that first occasion,” Johnston told the DCNF.2022 ATF O.5370.1E Federal Firearms Administrative Action Policy Procedures by Daily Caller News Foundation on ScribdThe updated guidance shows that\\xa0the “ATF must establish willfulness to proceed with revocation,” but the agency “does not have to establish a history of prior violations to determine willfulness,” according to the leaked document.“While relatively few licensees engage in such conduct, the negative effect that willful violations have on public safety can be immense. Consequently, the courts have also held that a single willful violation of a GCA regulation is a sufficient basis for ATF to revoke a federal firearms license,” Longnecker told the DCNF.The number of revocations jumped in 2022, but in the initial months of the “zero tolerance” policy, the ATF also began to revisit closed cases and retroactively revoke licenses, Johnston said.“After a gun store receives a warning conference, and you rectify your mistake, then you should be good. But the ATF, once the Biden administration announced zero tolerance, they went back and pulled all the people who received warning conferences, and then started reopening those cases and investigating them to punish them with zero tolerance,” Johnston told the DCNF.Amidst concerns in the gun community that the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy was being abused, a coalition of Republican lawmakers sent a letter\\xa0demanding the DOJ and the ATF turn over communications about how the legal definition of “willful” is being used to revoke FFLs from gun dealers.“The Biden-Harris Administration claims this policy will increase public safety and reduce crime. But revoking a FFL over minor paperwork issues turns a teachable moment into the end of a dealer’s livelihood. This new policy runs counter to the close working relationship firearm dealers have had with ATF for decades,” the letter says.(DAILY CALLER OBTAINED) — … by Henry RodgersThe Biden administration has until March 1 to turn over the appropriate information, according to the letter.“If you go back prior to the election we warned that both vice president Harris and Biden were going to use the ATF as a sledgehammer against the industry to do this. They promised they would do this, and they’re doing it. So none of this is a surprise to us. It is exactly what they said they would do and they’re doing it,” The Firearm Industry Trade Association (NSSF) Managing Director of Public Affairs Mark Oliva told the DCNF.“We’ve been calling to the attention of lawmakers that this is an overzealous use of a law enforcement function to run out this industry. It’s actually harmful and denigrates the ability for them to go after true criminals who are perpetrating crimes in the community,” Oliva continued.The DOJ did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Mike Loychik and Jean Schmidt introduced House Bill 51 into the Ohio Legislature on Feb. 15, saying the bill was a protection for police officers who did not want to enforce President Joe Biden’s “brigade against Ohioans,” according to The Columbus Dispatch. Under the bill, federal laws that relate to the “possession, ownership, use or transfer of a firearm, accessory or ammunition by law-abiding citizens,” or laws that call for “confiscating firearms, accessories or ammunition from law-abiding citizens” would be blocked from enforcement, according to the legislation.“Every police officer I’ve talked to in the last two years has expressed their opposition to ever being forced to become Joe Biden’s enforcement brigade against Ohioans,” Loychik told the Dispatch. “This bill protects those from ever having to make that decision.”Local governments that violate the bill will be be subject to civil lawsuits and penalties up to $50,000 for each violation, according to the legislation.(RELATED:\\xa0Red State Gov Refuses To Enforce Feds’ Pistol Brace Rule That ‘Erodes The Second Amendment’)The proposed legislation also blocks local governments from acting on federal laws that impose taxes on firearms or accessories that are not common or create a “chilling effect” for residents, according to the legislation. The bill will also block the enforcement of any registration or tracking of firearms, firearm accessories and firearm owners.Shall not be infringed means shall NOT be infringed.— Rep. Mike Loychik (@MikeLoychik) February 8, 2023 The bill mirrors a law passed in Missouri in 2021 that restricts the enforcement of federal laws which violate the state’s view of the Second Amendment, according to the Dispatch. The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Missouri after the law was passed, saying the state could not “simply declare federal laws invalid,” according to a DOJ press release.Loychik believes that HB 51 is even stronger than Missouri’s law, according to the Dispatch. “There have been changes that have been made. This bill is a lot stronger,” he said, noting that the bill will not violate the Supremacy Clause.“House Bill 51 does not challenge that,” Loychik said. “It simply states that the state of Ohio will not help the federal government agencies enforce their gun-control agenda by commandeering our local enforcement.”Earlier in February, Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, saying that Montana would not enforce the\\xa0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) final rule for pistol braces.The letter follows HB 258, passed by the Montana Legislature\\xa0in 2021, a law that blocks peace officers, state employees or employees of a political subdivision “from enforcing, assisting in the enforce of, or otherwise cooperating in the enforcement of a federal ban on firearms, magazines, or ammunition,” according to the legislation.“Our right to keep and bear arms is integral to Montana’s and our nation’s rich heritage, and this rule directly violates our long-held traditions. The rule also ignores the design and intent of stabilizing braces – to help disabled veterans fire large format pistols,” Gianforte said in the letter.Loychik and the DOJ did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We are committed to continuing to meet with and listen to our staff and students as we seek to build and further strengthen an environment that is welcoming to all.”Feb 2023 Press Release – In Response to Black History Month Lunch Menu by Kate on ScribdDeJonge also said in the school’s statement that they had consulted an “executive chef, Xaviar Jamarillo,” to create the meal for students and notified parents that the meal recognizing Black History Month would be taking place on Feb. 7, according to the apology. Students did not take to the meal, even after the school explained that it was trying to encourage an inclusive environment to “celebrate a variety of cultures.”DeJonge promised the school would consider how the “stereotypes” fail to “create the sense of inclusiveness, belonging and culture we espouse to achieve as a Christian school community,” and that students should feel able to voice their concerns to administrators, who will do better to “always be on alert,” according to the apology.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'A nonprofit organization that poured money from Mark Zuckerberg into election offices during the 2020 presidential election recently created a collaborative initiative that offers\\xa0“nonpartisan” assistance for election offices; however, the initiative’s partners and funding are tied to various left-leaning nonprofits, and the group’s\\xa0“unusual and complex structure” allows for loopholes to be found in laws that block public funding, election integrity watchdogs told the Daily Caller News Foundation.The group, the\\xa0Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), alongside various other “left-wing” nonprofits and companies, formed an $80 million initiative called the U.S. Alliance\\xa0for Election Excellence, which claims to assist election offices with grants, trainings, resources and consulting services, according to a report by the Honest Elections Project, a nonprofit\\xa0focused on election integrity. The Alliance, whose member offices are called “Centers for Election Excellence,” claims to be nonpartisan, but a review of documents by the Honest Elections Project and the John Locke Foundation shows that the group is designed to “systematically influence” aspects of the election administration and push “progressive” voting policies by working around laws that block public funding for election offices.“[The Alliance] allows CTCL and its partners to get into election offices, instead of parachuting in the way they did in 2020. They want to go to stay, they want to learn everything about how these offices function, they want to push, you know, what they term best practices, guidance, resources, trainings, technology, software, to reshape the way that they function,” Honest Elections Project\\xa0Executive Director and report co-author Jason Snead told the DCNF. “All of it is designed to basically give them behind-the-scenes access at a granular level, so that they can nudge, push, whatever, to get these offices to behave in ways which are more in line with their left-wing agenda.”CTCL is an\\xa0Illinois-based election reform advocacy group that pushes “left-of-center”\\xa0voting policies and election administration, according to Capitol Research Center’s (CRC) Influence Watch. The group has been funded by a wide array of organizations over the years, including the Skoll Foundation, the Democracy Fund, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.The group was founded by co-workers from the now defunct\\xa0New Organizing Institute (NOI), which has been described by The Washington Post as the “the Democratic Party’s Hogwarts for digital wizardry,” and was a training center for “left-of-center” activists while it existed, according to\\xa0Influence Watch.Alongside CTCL, the Alliance is composed of partners that include the\\xa0Center for Secure and Modern Elections, an Arabella Advisors\\xa0front group which lobbies for automatic voter registration, and the Center for Civic Design, which uses funding from liberal eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar to advocate for ballot redesign and permanent vote-by-mail, according to CRC.Arabella Advisors is a\\xa0nonprofit network that hosts a number of nonprofit groups that channel “hundreds of millions of dollars” from left-leaning foundations to left-wing organizations, according to Influence Watch. The group creates hundreds of “pop-up groups” designed to look like standalone projects, despite being Arabella-run.The Alliance’s newest partner, the\\xa0Institute for Responsive Government, works with government agencies to modernize election administration, specifically focusing on government-driven voter registration policies, according to CRC. The Institute for Responsive Government is housed by the\\xa0New Venture Fund, which is a nonprofit run by Arabella Advisors.“This is a coalition of left wing organizations, all of which have had deep ties through their senior staff, founders, etc, to the Democratic Party, to partisan campaigns on the left, and of course, to major left wing, dark money funders as well,” Snead told the DCNF. (RELATED:\\xa0Voter Participation Groups With Left-Wing Ties Threaten Voters With Peer Pressure)CTCL’s Alliance, dubbed “Zuck Bucks 2.0” by the Honest Elections Project, builds on the “Zuck Bucks” initiative, which used private funding to impact election policy nationwide in 2020, according to the Honest Elections Project. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan reportedly donated a total of $350 million to CTCL in 2020 to be dispensed as COVID-19 “relief grants” to election offices, leading a\\xa0group of House Republicans to call on CTCL to explain where the hundreds of millions of dollars they were given during the COVID-19 pandemic went.“During the 2020 election, Mark and Priscilla made a one-time donation to help address the unprecedented challenge of ensuring Americans could safely vote during the height of the pandemic. They have not made, and are not planning to make, any additional donations, including any additional donations to the Center for Tech and Civic Life,” Brian Baker, a spokesman for Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, told the DCNF.Following the “Zuck Bucks” initiative, many states implemented legislation that blocked private donations to election offices, but the CTCL’s Alliance is allegedly\\xa0moving around oversight by implementing a “membership” program with a “unusual and complex structure,” according to the Honest Elections Project.\\xa0“The second main thing that the alliance is set up to do is allow CTCL to spread even in states that ban private funding of elections. And we suspected that from the jump, which is why we put so much time into trying to understand what the Alliance looks like, what its structure was, so we can understand what their strategy is.” Snead said.Through public records requests, the Honest Elections Project received email communications between Alliance partners and local election offices selected to join the Alliance. The records, also reviewed by the John Locke Foundation, helped the Honest Elections Project look into the function of the Alliance, which showed the group’s alleged “behind-the-scenes influence” into\\xa0election administration.The Alliance started as a free group, but later added a membership fee and introduced “scholarships” to cover costs, which are now instantly converted into “credits,”\\xa0according to the Honest Elections Project. The “credits” must then be used to buy services from Alliance-sponsored partners.The “scholarship” to cover the membership cost can be used in states with weaker restrictions on public funding to provide funding for election offices without directly giving the office money, according to the Honest Elections Project.\\xa0The Alliance’s choice to offer scholarships to election offices is a “two fold” decision, Snead told the DCNF.The scholarships make it free for jurisdictions to join if they are allowed to accept funds, and also provides a loophole for states with less strict public funding laws.\\xa0“It’s almost like they’re doing a magic trick pretending that we say it costs $4,800 to join, but if we never bill you, and you’d never pay us, there’s no transaction, we just convert those fees into credits behind the scenes,” Snead told the DCNF.“I think it was very clearly designed to allow the influence of the Alliance to move into states where you cannot accept even the scholarship because of tightly worded private funding restrictions,” Snead said.The membership process seems to be a “two way street,” according to one election official in email records obtained by the Honest Elections Project. Election offices receive guidance, resources, trainings, technology and software to reshape the way that they function, and the Alliance receives information on how the member offices operate, as well as the ability to guide election offices through the use of its partner services.“I get something and give something,” one election official said about the agreement in documents obtained by the Honest Elections Project.The Honest Elections Project is still investigating how states with public funding bans are able to join the Alliance, and has submitted public record requests to further understand the onboarding process, according to Snead.“I fully expect that we will see other jurisdictions in states that have private funding bans targeted over the next days and weeks,” Snead said.Once election offices are locked in with the Alliance and the “credits” have been awarded, election offices work with the left-wing partners of the Alliance, according to the Honest Elections Project.“Instead of spending taxpayer dollars on any potential competitor to provide, for instance, a software solution to manage the recruitment and distribution of poll workers, they spent this money, now the money has to then effectively be spent on services that are provided by these CTCL approved collaborators,” Snead said.Congratulations to the 2023 inaugural cohort of Centers for Election Excellence! 🌟Contra Costa County, CA 🌟Shasta County, CA 🌟Greenwich, CT 🌟Kane County, IL 🌟Macoupin County, IL 🌟Ottawa County, MI 🌟Clark County, NV 🌟Brunswick County, NC 🌟Forsyth County, NC 🌟Madison, WI pic.twitter.com/FdSJQpYzIz— Center for Tech and Civic Life (@HelloCTCL) November 23, 2022 The Alliance initially recruited “Centers for Election Excellence” in states that did not block the use of private funding in election offices, but later expanded to states that block public funding, including Utah and Georgia, according to the Honest Elections Project.\\xa0Instead of sending funding directly to the election offices in Georgia, the Alliance sends funding to the respective county’s finance department, which later dispenses the funding to the election offices, CRC Senior Researcher Hayden Ludwig and Snead told the DCNF.“Georgia private funding restrictions are not the tightest and so they have essentially identified a loophole where the funding goes to the county and then the county appropriates it to the elections office,” Snead told the DCNF.\\xa0The Dekalb County, Georgia, finance department did not\\xa0immediately\\xa0respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.The Honest Elections Project is currently investigating how counties in Utah were able to join the Alliance.“Utah has fairly tight private funding restrictions. Again, the question is, did they get a membership fee to join the Alliance? Or did they take advantage of this scholarship program and pretend that that is somehow a satisfactory workaround?” Snead told the DCNF.The Alliance is marketed as a seal of approval for election offices that\\xa0excel at election administration, but after election offices were admitted, they were told that they would also be receiving massive grants, Snead told the DCNF.Many election officials were surprised by the large sums of money offered, leading election officials in Ottawa, Michigan, and Brunswick and Forsyth, North Carolina, to announce that they will not be taking any funding from the Alliance. Ottawa County\\xa0Clerk Justin Roebuck believes that some of the group’s initiatives are exciting, “but $1.5 million just seemed excessive,” he told the Holland Sentinel.“We didn’t ask for that. Honestly, we were very surprised and we want people in it for the right reasons,” Roebuck continued.Half of the original group of participating election offices are now facing some degree of pushback or expressing some reservations about joining the program, Snead told the DCNF.Governors in Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina\\xa0and Wisconsin vetoed legislation banning private funding in 2021, and Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina have election offices that are participating in the Alliance.\\xa0The respective offices did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.If voters are going to have faith that CTCL is operating in a nonpartisan manner, “the process for awarding the money should be more transparent,” Ludwig told RealClearInvestigations.If the CTCL Alliance is truly committed to helping election offices,\\xa0“they would be advocating through democratic channels to expand budgets, going into state legislatures to support infrastructure. But they don’t and they have millions of dollars at their disposal,”\\xa0he continued.CTCL, the Center for Secure and Modern Elections and the Center for Civic Design\\xa0did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.The Institute for Responsive Government could not be reached for comment.This article has been updated with comment from a spokesperson for Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In response, multiple organizations came out in support of Sheehi, claiming that she was the target of Zionists and that her right to free speech was being taken away, but some clinicians with Psychologists Against Antisemitism, an independent organization made up of more than 300 psychologists, wrote a letter Tuesday to offer their support to GWU’s Jewish students, according to a post from PAA’s Facebook page.The letter said the group was “deeply troubled” about the accusations by some of their colleagues that the students’ claims “were fabrications.” (RELATED: Major University Weighs Antisemitism Charges Against Pro-Palestine Student Group)“Many of our psychology colleagues have chosen to label your experiences as ‘specious,’ without any evidence or knowledge of what really happened, thereby delegitimizing the entire complaint filed with the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education,” the letter read. “In essence, they have chosen to politicize this case and attack the media outlets and others who have given voice to your experiences, portraying them as right-wing and conspiratorial (an old antisemitic trope).”In the 2022 fall semester, Jewish students in Sheehi’s class were reportedly subjected to a “pervasive, hostile, and discriminatory environment” after she invited Dr. Shalhoub-Kevorkian, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who has a history of making antisemitic claims about Israel, to speak at a class, according to the complaint. Students attempted to address their concerns with the university administration but were informed that Sheehi had been making accusations against the students and subsequently told they would have to attend disciplinary hearings.PAA further explained in the letter that the groups that had come forward to support Sheehi made it clear they didn’t understand the nature of the allegations, according to the letter. The Arab-American-Anti-Discrimination Committee announced on Jan. 24 that they would be representing Sheehi, while the Board of Directors of Division 39 of the American Psychological Association also released a statement of support, and a group of GWU students and alumni began circulating a letter and petition calling the claims against Sheehi “deeply harmful.”TOPSHOT – A man holds a “Free Palestine” sign during a demonstration in support of Palestine in Brooklyn, New York on May 15, 2021. (Photo by KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)These arguments did not convince PAA, who noted that, unlike students, Sheehi has “a lot of resources to support her relative to students,” according to the letter.“Rather than demonstrate any interest in what you students, our future psychologists, have said about your experience of being treated differently because of your Jewish identity, Dr. Sheehi is portrayed and labeled as the victim,” PAA said. “While Dr. Sheehi is a woman of color, she is also a full-time professor; author; on the editorial board of Psychoanalysis, Culture, and Society; on the advisory board to the USA-Palestine Mental Health Network; and President of APA’s Division 39.”Julie Ancis, professor and founder of PAA, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that many people possess “blind allegiance” to certain causes and leaders regardless of the issue.“I wonder how many of these supporters of Sheehi have read the detailed complaint filed by StandWithUs,” she said. “Considering the prevalence of antisemitism across college campuses, I felt that it was our obligation to come forward on behalf of students whose voices seemed to have been silenced both within their training program and regretfully among professional colleagues.”SWU told the DCNF that they were grateful for “showing leadership and moral clarity in their support of Jewish and Israeli students” and said that they hoped that others in the field of psychology would “look to this example.”GWU did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Idriss and her attorney argued that NYU’s decision was “very troubling” and that Idriss was the “only one not rehired.”Dylan Saba, Idriss’ attorney, claimed that the university discriminated against Idriss because she was of Arab descent, according to The Electronic Intifada. He also said the vandalism charge would not have been an issue if it did not pertain to an “anti-Israel message.”Liora Rez, executive director of StopAntisemitism, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that SA was pleased that NYU was “taking this seriously.”NYU and Palestinian Legal did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Republican representatives urged Democratic lawmakers to vote against the bill, saying it would penalize legal gun owners.Two additional lawsuits were filed against HB 5471 within the first week of its passing.

A Facebook employee wrote an email later that day asking Biden administration COVID-19 czar Andrew Slavitt for “any messaging” that the White House might want the company to promote, looping in White House Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty and Director of Strategic Communications and Engagement for the COVID-19 Response Team Courtney Rowe in a follow-up email moments later, according to documents obtained by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) and shared with the DCNF. (RELATED: ‘These Questions Weren’t Rhetorical’: White House Staff Grilled Facebook For Not Censoring Tucker Carlson, Docs Show)The NCLA is party to an ongoing lawsuit filed by the Attorneys General of Louisiana and Missouri alleging improper collusion between the federal government and social media companies, and obtained the emails via discovery.“Re the J+J news, we’re keen to amplify any messaging you want us to project about what this means for people – it obviously has the risk of exacerbating vaccine hesitancy, so we’re keen to get ahead of the knock-on effect,” the employee wrote. “Don’t hesitate to tell me – or via your teams – how we can help you provide clarity/reassurance via Facebook.”A Facebook employee, whose name is redacted, requests guidance from the Biden administration about how the company ought to respond to the FDA and CDC’s decision to pause use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, April 13, 2021.

The White House official would go on to say he was “happy to provide” more specifics about what the information in the context panel “should be.”In addition, he provided Facebook with a statement from the White House, and informed the company that the CDC would be putting together a FAQ sheet on the J&J vaccine that the White House would “love to have amplified in whatever way possible,” according to the emails. Finally, Flaherty asked that Facebook commit to spreading as much positive news about the vaccine as negative, even going so far as to request that the company alter its algorithms to do so.Flaherty believed that a “commitment from [Facebook] to make sure that a favorable review reaches as many people as the pause, either through hard product interventions or algorithmic amplification,” would be helpful to prevent “misinformation” surrounding the J&J vaccine, according to the emails.White House Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty responds to a Facebook employee requesting guidance on how to respond to the CDC and FDA’s decision to pause use of the Johnson & Johnson single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, April 13, 2021.

The employee also thanked Flaherty for his willingness to provide the CDC messaging, before promising that the company would “love to talk” about possibly modifying its algorithm to alter how information is shared and concluding with a promise to share data relating to “misinformation.”Flaherty would spar with the company over the next week, seemingly over its refusal to censor Tucker Carlson’s criticism of the J&J vaccine and the administration’s vaccine messaging. The FDA ultimately restricted the use of the J&J vaccine to those who refused or were ineligible to take other vaccines, citing the risks associated with blood clots, in a statement issued May 5, 2022.Meta and the White House did not immediately respond to a Daily Caller News Foundation request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Staffers who appeared to be members of the safety team — all names were redacted aside from safety team member Anika Navaroli — discussed this new argument, with one reporting that the scaled enforcement team “said they understand our position but will continue to push their [glorification of violence] assessment with leadership,” according to Weiss.Another apparent safety team member reported that some staff members viewed Trump “as the leader of a terrorist group responsible for violence/deaths comparable to Christchurch shooter or Hitler and on that basis and on the totality of his Tweets, he should be deplatformed,” according to Weiss. “They will continue to push that argument with leadership and we will see where it falls.”After then-CEO Jack Dorsey and Gadde hosted a 30-minute all-staff meeting to answer questions about the company’s response to Trump, some employees got even more frustrated, with then-head of health and safety Yoel Roth reporting that some employees were “suggesting that people implementing our policies are like Nazis following orders,” according to Weiss.Soon after, Dorsey requested a simple argument to justify a Trump ban, Weiss reported.When Twitter issued its ban, its justifications mirrored those initially presented by Gadde, noting that the mention of a “GIANT VOICE” that demanded respect, in addition to the use of the phrase “American Patriots,” could be interpreted by rioters and other violent actors as condoning their actions, according to a Jan. 8 blog post by Twitter. By confirming he would not attend the inauguration, Trump could be signaling to those violent actors that it was a “‘safe’ target.”Twitter did not immediately respond to a Daily Caller News Foundation request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'The House Judiciary Committee majority is bringing conservative-turned-progressive activist Rev. Robert Schenck as a witness to a hearing on Thursday over allegations that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito leaked court opinions in 2014, despite the Supreme Court in 1996 deeming Schenck “not entirely credible.”Thursday’s hearing, entitled “Undue Influence: ‘Operation Higher Court’ and Politicking at SCOTUS” comes as a report of the allegations that Alito leaked information to a couple who had contact with Schenck. The reverend is slated to be the Democrats’ star witness during the hearing despite the Supreme Court’s conclusion that Schenck was an unreliable witness.In the 1996 case, Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York, Schenck’s twin brother, Paul Schenck, was at the center of a lawsuit regarding attempts to “provoke” an escort outside an abortion clinic, according to the Buffalo News. Schenck was a witness on his brother’s behalf.“At the hearing, the Schencks insisted that they were not present at 1241 Main Street on December 29, 1990 as part of Project Rescue. Rather, they contend that they were there only to evangelize and preach. The Court finds, however, that their testimony in this regard is not credible,” court documents obtained by Daily Caller News Foundation read.The Court also questioned both brothers about allegations that they had switched clothes to mislead the pro-abortion advocates regarding Paul Schenck’s identity. When neither brother recalled the incident the Court stated that it believed “the Schencks’ inability to recollect the incident to be totally incredible.”Despite this history, the House Judiciary Committee is set to listen to Schenck’s allegations published in a New York Times report claiming he obtained information about the Supreme Court majority opinion for the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. case after Alito had dinner with Schenck’s mutual friends.Mark Paoletta, a partner with the law firm Schaffer Jaffe and Republicans’ sole witness for the hearing, told the DCNF that the committee was simply attempting to link Alito to the Hobby Lobby allegations and ultimately to the Dobbs leak.\\xa0“They’re connecting these two allegations, in my view baseless allegations, to connect Alito to the Dobbs leak,” he stated. “It’s completely false, but that’s what they’re trying to do.”The reverend has a long history of attempting to influence conservative judges through prayer and conversation, according to Rolling Stone.\\xa0Schenck’s nonprofit Faith Action was designed\\xa0 “to create an ecosystem of support for conservative justices, as a way of making them more forthright in their views,” according to Politico. Schenck fundraised donations based on the idea that he could influence the bench to overturn Roe, despite Schenck later admitting that he was only ever able to reach Justices Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Alito, who were already firmly pro-life, according to the Times report. (RELATED: ‘I Identify As An American Indian’: Alito Appears To Troll Defenders Of Affirmative Action)Gayle Wright and her husband, Don Wright, had dinner with Justice Alito and his wife in 2014 and Schenck alleges that following this dinner Wright called him and told him that Alito had told her and her husband the outcome of the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case, according to the Times. Wright and Alito denied Schenck’s accusation.Schenck’s claims were similarly denied by Paoletta, who told the DCNF that Schenck admitted in his own blog to being less than honest.“[Y]ou have Robert Schenck, who is not a reliable narrator of the truth, as evidenced by his own admission that he is a self-confessed liar of consequential lies, I think he says on his blog, and that other federal courts have found him to be a liar,” he explained.“In my 64-plus years, I’ve not only believed a fair number of consequential lies, I’ve promulgated them,” Schenck\\xa0wrote on the blog. “Sometimes I did it knowingly, and at other times, unwittingly. I also protected lies told by others. I’m resolved not to do any of this anymore.”A Hobby Lobby store is seen on June 30, 2014, in Plantation, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Paoletta also questioned the intentions of the committee by bringing Schenck in as a witness, noting that the reverend’s claims have been denied by the two other individuals involved in the supposed leak.“My understanding of the reporting is that Gayle, absolutely disputes that the Alitos disclosed anything to her,” Paoletta said. “I think the Democrats don’t want to have her come [to the hearing] because she would dispute what Rob Schenck is peddling.”In 2015, Schenck joined forces with the great-grandniece of Walt Disney, Abigail Disney, for the documentary “The Amor of Light” focusing on the contradictions of being pro-life and pro-gun. In 2018, Schenck left Faith and Action and went to work full-time at the Dietrick Bonhoeffer Institute (DBI) he’d started in 2016 with Disney’s help, according to CNN.DBI was bankrolled by Disney and organizations like the California Community Foundation, a left-wing Los Angeles-based activist group that gave it more than $1.8 million over four years.A year later in 2019, Schenck wrote an opinion piece for the Times explaining how he had pivoted from being pro-life to pro-choice.“Over the last decade, I have changed my view on Roe. I’ve come to believe that overturning Roe would not be “pro-life”; rather, it would be destructive of life,” he wrote.Schenck sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts dated June 7, 2022, according to the Times. The letter addressed Schenck’s concerns about the Dobbs leak that had occurred in May and explained he had known of an earlier leak regarding the Hobby Lobby decision in 2014.“Considering there may be a severe penalty to be paid by whoever is responsible for the initial leak of the recent draft opinion, thought this previous incident might bear some consideration by you and others involved in the process,” Schenck wrote. “Of course, I would be happy to fully cooperate should you find any value in other details surrounding what I have transmitted here.”The Times said that there were “gaps” in Schenck’s story, but concluded that after “months of examining Mr. Schenck’s claims,” it was likely that Schenck “knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.”The Supreme Court and Schenck did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment. Wright could not be reached for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Supreme Court ruled that Phillips was not given a fair hearing before the state Civil Rights Commission due to anti-religious bias. The court did not, however, overturn Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws or answer the question of whether Phillips had the right to discriminate against LGBT couples.Gorsuch invoked the case Monday while questioning Colorado Solicitor General Eric Olson.“Mr. Phillips did go through a reeducation program pursuant to Colorado law, did he not?” Gorsuch asked.

Fraudulent payouts amounting to $45.6 billion would thus account for roughly 5.75% of pandemic-related unemployment benefits.“This milestone of 1,000 individuals being charged with crimes involving UI fraud and the identification of $45.6 billion in potentially fraudulent UI payments highlights the magnitude of this problem,” said Inspector General Larry Turner in the OIG’s press release. “Hundreds of billions in pandemic funds attracted fraudsters seeking to exploit the UI program—resulting in historic levels of fraud and other improper payments.”BREAKING: Labor Department IG says $45.6 billion stolen from unemployment insurance program using social security numbers from dead people and prisoners— Lucas Tomlinson (@LucasFoxNews) September 22, 2022 The DOL-OIG notes that the program was exploited with “easily attainable” personally identifiable information by both individual fraudsters and “organized criminal groups,” in its report. To combat the growing problem, the DOL-OIG subpoenaed the records of every state to build a national database of UI records.More than 190,000 investigations into UI fraud have been launched since the pandemic began, more than 1,000 times the typical volume, the DOL-OIG reported. With less than 140 criminal investigators, the organization was forced to focus on organized crime and “large-scale identity theft schemes.”In one case, 11 “members and associates of a gang.” were convicted for the theft of roughly $4.3 million in UI benefits, according to the DOL-OIG. While the DOL-OIG report notes that the defendants filed for approximately $20 million worth of benefits, it does not say whether the agency or the Department of Justice (DOJ), who collaborated with the DOL-OIG to combat fraud, was able to recover any of the money that was paid out.The recently-passed CHIPs Act, which has been praised by President Joe Biden for helping to “build the future in America,” allocated  $50 billion in incentives for manufacturing projects in the U.S. This is just $4.4 billion more than the fraud announced Thursday by the DOL-OIG.The DOL-OIG declined to comment, referring the Daily Caller News Foundation to its press release.The DOJ did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The announcement comes as small business optimism languishes near record lows, according to a JCN poll conducted by pollsters John McLaughlin & Scott Rasmussen. (RELATED: ‘Raw Deal’: Small Business Owners Sound The Alarm Over Economy, Poll Shows)“Never before has Mainstreet been under such an assault as policymakers levy a growing number of regulations and taxes on small businesses,” Gingrich and Ortiz said in a joint statement given to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That’s why we’ve partnered on this plan to help strengthen the small business community, which is the backbone of the U.S. economy.”“With the ongoing chronic labor shortage, small businesses must constantly improve their wages & working conditions or risk losing their employees to competitors,” stated @JobCreatorsUSA‘s @Elaine_Parker at @FairGrowthCmte‘s roundtable on #CorporateResponsibility. pic.twitter.com/GpaLBJgcGS— Economic Disparity & Fairness in Growth Committee (@FairGrowthCmte) September 21, 2022 The plan also calls for reduced red tape for small business, and would exempt them from new federal regulations by default, putting the onus on Congress to prove their necessity, according to Ortiz. Speakers\\xa0 at the event also touted the plan’s commitment to providing more capital for small businesses, which Ortiz characterized as being crucial for empowering minority-owned small businesses in an interview with the DCNF.Speakers discussed the impact of the Federal Reserve’s ongoing battle with inflation, and argued that the interest rate hikes announced Wednesday would put further strain on employers.“When you’re trying to get a piece of equipment that’s a million dollars, those [increases] really do mean a lot,” said Nicole Wolter, small business owner of the H M Manufacturing, speaking at the event. “It’s clear that the climate for small business has soured.”Inflation persisted in August at 8.3% annually; more than four times the Fed’s goal of 2% annual inflation. President Joe Biden has repeatedly downplayed the impacts of inflation, going so far as to claim the Inflation Reduction Act has helped reduce costs “at the kitchen table,” despite historically high grocery prices.Ortiz noted that he hoped the plan would be embraced by politicians regardless of political affiliation, and that Republicans would find it complimented House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s “Commitment to America” plan, to be announced later this week. Gingrich characterized the Small Business Prosperity Plan as “a very important step” to an American economic recovery.“This is something that has to get done,” said Ortiz.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The latest polling has 39% of voters backing Attorney General Eric Schmitt, followed by U.S. Rep.

I’m tapping out,'” said Keller.Greitens’ campaign told Politico that the poll numbers were inaccurate but did not provide alternative polling to verify the claim.“Fake poll numbers peddled by grifters are an albatross in the political world and Governor Greitens will become the next U.S. senator from Missouri,” \\xa0Greitens’ campaign manager Dylan Johnson told Politico.Greitens has angled his messaging around Trump’s core policies of securing the southern border and incentivizing tax reform, according to his campaign website.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Democrats have firmly held Oregon’s gubernatorial office since 1987, but with the party deeply unpopular and a duo of competitive challengers, that could change in November.The race is neck and neck according to the most recent polling coming out of Nelson Research in late May. Former House Minority Leader Republican Christine Drazan stands at just under 30% and former Democrat House Speaker Tina Kotek at 28%, while Independent Betsy Johnson lags behind at roughly 19%. Democratic incumbent Kate Brown cannot run for reelection.After eight years in office, Brown is the least-popular governor in the nation, according to a Jan. 1-March 31 Morning Consult poll. During her tenure, Oregon has seen increasing rates of homelessness and crime, which along with poor government leadership constitute the top three issues for Oregon’s voters, per Oregon Public Broadcasting polling. (RELATED: Oregon Education Department Mandates That School Put Period Products In Boys And Girls Bathrooms)\\xa0In 2021 Portland alone witnessed 92 homicides, an all-time record and stark increase from 36 in 2019. But Brown nonetheless touts a lenient approach to crime; in April she granted clemency to a murderer serving life without parole for the cold-blooded killing of a teenager, and during riots in Portland in July 2020 she criticized former President Donald Trump for sending in federal agents to protect a federal courthouse as local and state police stood by.Brown’s approval has been particularly lackluster in more rural counties east of the Cascade Mountains, nine of which have actually voted to leave Oregon to form “Greater Idaho.”In Brown’s stead running on the Democratic ticket is Kotek, a Portland-based Democrat seen by many as more of the same, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. In announcing her candidacy in January, Kotek released a list\\xa0of accomplishments from her time in the state legislature that included expanding health care coverage to undocumented Oregonians, mandating the use of lower-polluting auto fuels, increasing the minimum wage, restricting how local governments can enforce homeless camping bans, expanding gun control and codifying legal abortion.Reproductive freedom and abortion access is on the ballot this year.@ChristineDrazan and @senbetsyjohnson are proud to flaunt endorsements from anti-choice extremists.You can count on me to stand up for abortion access here in Oregon. Because I’ve been doing it for years.— Tina Kotek (@TinaKotek) June 27, 2022 “Thinking that repeating the same failed policies on drugs, crime, and homelessness will yield different results is not just failing to reason properly, it’s also irresponsible,” Portland-based public intellectual and philosopher Peter Boghossian told The Daily Caller News Foundation.Kotek’s campaign did not respond to TheDCNF’s request for comment on how she differentiates herself from the unpopular Brown.Seeking to capitalize on the fact that just 18% of Oregonians believe the state to be headed in the right direction under current leadership are Betsy Johnson, an established Democratic legislator in the state who left her party to mount a more moderate campaign as an Independent, and Christine Drazan, a pro-Trump Republican who marks a shift from the more moderate conservatives that the Oregon G.O.P. has nominated in recent years.While Oregon has not had\\xa0a Republican Governor since 1987, and the party has won just one statewide race since 2000, Drazan’s campaign manager Trey Rosser is confident in their chances.“Oregonians are waking up to [Democrats’] failed records and looking for someone who will lead our state,” he told TheDCNF. “Tina Kotek, Betsy Johnson, and Governor Kate Brown bear the brunt of responsibility for Oregon’s decade of decline. Together, they’ve raised taxes by billions, allowed our streets to descend into chaos and violence, passed policies that have exacerbated our homeless crisis, and left our schools mired in mediocrity.”Due to the competitive three-way field Republican political consultant Rebecca Tweed expects the race to be “the most expensive campaign for Governor in Oregon’s history.” With months to go and money to be spent, the race is one to keep an eye on, but it may ultimately hinge on whether centrist Johnson siphons more votes from the left or right.The Johnson campaign did not respond to The DCNF’s request for comment.The Nelson poll was conducted among 516 likely voters with a 4.3% margin of error.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Due to the bill’s nature, specifically that it does not outright outlaw the purchase of firearms, Beyer intends for the bill to pass in the Senate without GOP support using the budget reconciliation process.A new AR-15 rifle ranges in price from roughly $500 to over $2,000, according to NBC News.

If so, does China call on Russia to respect the democratically elected government of Ukraine?” a reporter asked.“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and safeguarded, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be jointly upheld,” Wang responded.“At the same time, China has always believed that the security of one country cannot be built on the basis of undermining the security of other countries, let alone wantonly undermine the sovereignty and security of other countries in pursuit of its own absolute military advantage,” he added.While the criticism did not mention Russia directly, some observers argue China’s stance is shifting as world governments unite to condemn and punish Putin’s invasion.Seriously.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images for WarnerMedia)Trump had a deeply antagonistic relationship with CNN throughout his presidency, particularly with the network’s former senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta.The circumstances of Zucker’s sudden departure have been the subject of palace intrigue in recent days. Reported leaks from a meeting between top-level CNN staff and Kilar the night of Zucker’s resignation suggested that CNN employees were frustrated with the move. The network’s White House correspondent, Kaitlan Collins, argued that Zucker’s ouster came as a result of a lawsuit from disgraced former host Chris Cuomo, who was forced out of the organization for sexual misconduct allegations and journalistic malpractice.Cuomo sued CNN to be paid the remainder of his contract and reportedly pushed for an investigation into Zucker and Gollust’s relationship. Collins, who has worked for the Daily Caller in the past, reportedly argued that Zucker’s departure sent a message that the network was bending to Cuomo’s threats.'},\n",

Virginia Foxx and Sen. Richard Burr, comes in light of news that a 12-year-old girl reportedly attempted suicide on a school bus in Clay County, Florida,\\xa0after her school began referring to her a boy and calling her by a new name without disclosing the student’s gender identity to her parents.The incident was part of a broader trend of schools concealing vital information from parents about their minor children, particularly concerning gender identity issues.“The sheer fact that a 12-year-old student attempted to take her life after her own school refused to disclose conversations about a gender transition to her parents is repulsive,” Foxx told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Parents across this country deserve to know vital information about their children – and not be blindsided by the very people that are entrusted to teach them.”Foxx and Burr urged Cardona to clarify that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) explicitly states that schools cannot have policies that deny parents the right to review the educational records of their children. “Actively concealing vital health information from parents ‘effectively prevents’ parents from accessing information to which they are entitled,” the letter said.The letter also challenged guidance from the Obama administration instructing schools to treat gender identity as a protected category through Title IX, which has traditionally been used to promote gender equality in education. (RELATED: ‘Several’ Unnamed Female Swimmers Voice Support For Trans Teammate In Unsigned Letter)Foxx and Burr close the letter with a list of questions they expect the Department of Education to answer in the next two weeks clarifying the department’s interpretation of Title IX and the obligation of schools to disclose mental health crises to parents.Virginia Supreme Court Reinstates Teacher Removed For Speaking Out Against Gender Policy https://t.co/5C9y8rG8CO— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 1, 2021 The letter asks whether “school personnel should practice other forms of medical or psychological treatment without appropriate licensure or training” and “what other medical or psychological treatments [the department believes] that school personnel should provide to minor children without parental consent.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Marsha Blackburn and Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut\\xa0and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, would prevent app stores such as Google Play and Apple’s App Store from requiring developers to use the tech giants’ in-app payment systems as a condition of distribution. This requirement, the bill’s authors argue, allows Apple and Google to collect large commissions on in-app payments, to the detriment of app developers.The panel passed the bill 21-1, with only Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn voting against approval. The bill will now head to the Senate floor.Republican Colorado Rep. Ken Buck and Democratic Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson have also introduced a House companion to the legislation. (RELATED: Popular Bible, Quran Apps Deleted From Apple’s Chinese App Store After Government Pressure)“It is important that our legislative agenda adapts with the times, and technology has outpaced legislation to such a grave extent that more burdensome measures are now necessary to reign in big tech,” Blackburn said in her prepared remarks. “I’m not here to break up companies, but I am here to put executives and boards on notice.The committee approved a manager’s amendment to the bill introduced by Blumenthal that aims to clarify language allowing tech companies to enforce certain privacy and cybersecurity requirements on app developers. Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis proposed three amendments, each of which were rejected, while Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz withdrew one amendment after being assured the bill would be focused on “monopolists.”Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks with former TIME managing editor Nancy Gibbs at the TIME 100 Summit on April 23, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Democratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein voiced her opposition to parts of the bill, arguing that as the legislation only covered companies with over 50 million users a month, it was intended to target Apple, Google and Microsoft.“I’m concerned this number was selected as a way to single out particular companies, three California companies,” Feinstein said.Cornyn stressed the need for a hearing on the bill, arguing that cybersecurity and privacy concerns posed by the legislation were not properly addressed and focusing on the national security threat posed by Chinese hacking of devices. Klobuchar dismissed these concerns as “another argument by the tech companies” much to the chagrin of several Republican senators.“I’m being told that every time I ask a question I’m in the pocket of Big Tech,” Republican Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy said, referring to Klobuchar’s statement.Apple and Google, the two companies most affected by the legislation, echoed Cornyn’s arguments, arguing the bill would degrade consumer privacy and security. Apple maintained that by allowing “sideloading” of apps, or the downloading of apps on Apple devices from outside the App Store, consumers could inadvertently download dangerous apps or malware.Apple senior director of government affairs Tim Powderly reportedly sent a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee members Wednesday arguing the bill would force app stores to allow unvetted apps, which “erects a nearly insurmountable obstacle for all but the most basic [privacy] safeguards” and risks allowing malware.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Obama administration awarded Wisconsin, led by former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, $810 million for the project in 2009.

Scott Walker was elected in 2010. Walker promised to distance the state from the project during his campaign, garnering angry letters from then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.“Unless you change your position, we plan to engage in an orderly transition to wind down Wisconsin’s project so that we do not waste taxpayer’s money,” LaHood wrote in a November 2010 letter to Walker.After the administration nixed the project, it transferred the funds to California for a different rail project. That plan, however, has largely failed, with officials scaling it back and critics dubbing it the “bullet train to nowhere.”Still, Talgo, the private company contracted to develop the rail line, built the two trains by 2012 and billed Wisconsin, according to WPR. Talgo then terminated its contract with Wisconsin and sued the state over the project.“It’s a little bittersweet,” Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said on Tuesday, WPR reported. “I’m sending my congratulations to the governor in Lagos State in Nigeria, but also a little disappointed that we missed out on the opportunity to have those trainsets operating here in Milwaukee and in Wisconsin.”The Lagos metro project is expected to begin operation by the end of 2022 and carry 500,000 passengers per day.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Philanthropy can greatly aid in achieving this crucial goal.”The Minnesota Freedom Fund helped post bail for multiple individuals accused of committing violent crimes after donations started pouring in following Floyd’s killing, the Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported. The bail fund helped bail out a man accused of assaulting an elderly woman as he burglarized her home, court records show, as well as an additional six men accused of domestic violence between June and August 2020.And in August 2021, a Minneapolis man allegedly shot and killed a driver during a road rage incident just weeks after the Minnesota Freedom Fund helped release him from jail on an unrelated domestic assault case.“We are aware of reports of the tragic and fatal shooting in Minneapolis earlier this week allegedly involving George Howard, an individual the Minnesota Freedom Fund had previously provided with bail support,” the group said in a now-deleted tweet in early September. “MFF believes that every individual who has been arrested by the law enforcement is innocent until proven guilty, and if a judge deems them eligible for bail, they should not have to wait in jail simply because they don’t have the same income or access to resources as others.”The Tides Center also provided $737,000 to the Louisville Community Bail Fund, which, according to Wave 3 News, helped post bail for dozens of people in 2020 that faced charges for violent crimes including rape, domestic violence and murder.The Tides organizations are not required to publicly disclose the identity of their donors due to being structured as 501(c)(3) charity groups. Known donors to Tides groups include left-wing billionaires George Soros and Pierre Omidyar, according to Influence Watch.“Anonymity is very important to most of the people we work with,” Tides founder Drummond Pike said in 2004.Tides did not return a request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Republican Society at The Citadel military college in South Carolina grants the award annually, and the event is a common stomping ground for would-be Republican presidential candidates.“In Washington, D.C., we have a President and a Congress who are leading the greatest nation in history toward ruin,” she told the audience. “They’re crippling our economy, crushing our families, endangering our streets, erasing our borders and withdrawing from the world.”WASHINGTON, DC – NOVEMBER 30: U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks before signing a series of veteran-related bills at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on November 30, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)“Joe Biden and today’s Democratic Party doesn’t even believe in America,” she continued. “And they’re not alone. The media, the education establishment, CEOs from Wall Street to Silicon Valley —They all say our country is racist and rotten to the core. They’re corrupting the minds of the next generation. They’re throwing away our national principles and putting new ones in place. For them, freedom, equality, opportunity and the rule of law are out.”The Republican Society grants the award and accompanying replica Revolutionary War musket annually, and Haley is the first woman to receive it. Former President Donald Trump received his award prior to being elected president in 2015, and former Vice President Mike Pence received the award in 2020. (RELATED: Nikki Haley: Liberal Media ‘Can’t Stand It When A Brown Republican’ Claims America Isn’t Racist)Haley enjoys a unique position among potential Republican presidential candidates in 2024. Haley served as Trump’s ambassador to the U.N. for much of his administration, resigning amicably in late 2018. Having done so, she holds reasonable legitimacy among Trump’s base even while dodging any connection to Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.Haley has distanced herself from Trump in the wake of 2020, and condemned the the pro-Trump storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. She has faced some jabs from the former president as a result.South Carolina, the first Southern state to vote in Republican primaries, is a common stomping ground for would-be Republican presidential candidates. She also has plans to travel the country to gin up Republican support ahead of the 2022 midterms. She already campaigned for Republican Virginia gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin, whose victory last month Haley called “a bad day for Joe Biden.”“The Republican Party was made for this moment,” she said near the end of her speech. “We’re the only ones who can unite our country. Who can rescue our cities from anarchy and anger. Who can move America forward and upward. We are the only ones who can. And we are the ones who will – in 2022 and 2024.”Haley’s decision on 2024 may hinge on Trump’s own decision to run, however. She told reporters in April that she would bow out of any race and support Trump should he decide to run again.'},\n",

The statement does not specifically mention any politician, and nor does it instruct priests to withhold communion, but it does urge Catholics individually to avoid communion of their own accord if they “knowingly and obstinately” reject the teachings of the church.The statement comes weeks after the USCCB sent a letter to Congress urging lawmakers to remove funding for abortion from Biden’s Build Back Better Act, which the president is still struggling to pass. The Catholic Church has long taught that abortion is a murder and a mortal sin, with Pope Francis calling it “homicide.” (RELATED: Vatican Cancels Plans To Livestream Biden’s Meeting With Pope Francis)Pope Francis waves, next to US Vice President Joe Biden, on a balcony after speaking at the US Capitol building in Washington, DC on September 24, 2015.\\xa0 (Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images)Biden met with Francis during a trip to Rome in late October, and Biden said the pair did not discuss abortion. Biden said Francis told him he should be taking communion. As the USCCB’s Wednesday statement states, the church has long said that “One should not celebrate Mass or receive holy Communion in the state of mortal sin without having sought the sacrament of reconciliation and received absolution.”U.S. Catholics said they did not expect the USCCB to specifically condemn politicians in the statement, let alone name any individuals. Pro-life activist and devout Catholic Lila Rose told the Daily Caller in October that the statement was likely only to remind faithful Catholics what it means to be faithful, and that the decision to withhold communion from an individual rests with their priests.“The Catholic Church has been crystal clear about how one should receive Holy Communion. The law is, do not present yourself for communion while in a state of willful mortal sin,” Rose said at the time. “The teaching from the church has been set for centuries. It’s not going to change.”'},\n",

Even as Pope Francis has aggressively upheld the Church’s long-standing teaching that abortion is murder, the Biden administration has been embroiled in a battle to pass a budget plan that would end the Hyde Amendment, which for decades has prevented U.S. taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. (RELATED: Vatican Cancels Plans To Livestream Biden’s Meeting With Pope Francis)“The Hyde Amendment is the perfect example of the utter phoniness of Biden’s position on abortion,” said Brian Burch, executive director CatholicVote, an organization devoted to upholding Catholic teachings in politics. “He says he believes abortion is wrong, but doesn’t want to force that personal belief on women. But now he wants to force Americans to pay for abortions regardless of their beliefs.”“Catholics of any political background carry deep respect for the Papacy. What we hope is for Biden to show the kind of respect due the Papacy given his Catholic faith, and humility given his gross defiance of the Church,” Burch told the Daily Caller.WASHINGTON, DC – JUNE 5: President Joe Biden walks into Holy Trinity Catholic Church to attend Mass on June 5, 2021, in Washington, DC. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) will meet for its fall conference in a matter of weeks, and on the agenda: drafting a statement on the meaning of communion. Many expect the statement to clarify whether priests should withhold communion from high-profile, pro-choice politicians who publicly reject the Church’s teachings on abortion. The statement, however, is likely only to remind faithful Catholics what it means to be faithful, says Lila Rose, a devout Catholic and president of the pro-life advocacy group Live Action. Ultimately, the decision to withhold communion from an individual rests with their priests.“The Catholic Church has been crystal clear about how one should receive Holy Communion. The law is, do not present yourself for communion while in a state of willful mortal sin,” Rose said, adding that there are case-by-case considerations that make a blanket policy difficult, such as whether a person may have gone to confession before seeking communion. “The teaching from the church has been set for centuries. It’s not going to change.”Burch echoed that sentiment, saying no statement from the USCCB would mention Biden or any other politician by name. He added that faithful Catholics pray for Biden to change his position on these core teachings not only for the sake of policy but also for the sake of his own soul.“It’s about also a deep desire to reform that person and to bring them back into full communion with the Church,” Burch said.Pope Francis himself has not weighed in on the specific issue of withholding communion from pro-choice politicians, saying in September that he did not know enough “details” about U.S. politics.“Scientifically it’s a human life,” the Holy Father said at the time. “The textbooks teach us that. But is it right to take it out to solve a problem? And this is why the Church is so strict on this issue because it is kind of like accepting this is accepting daily murder.”“What should the pastor do?” the pope went on to ask. “Be a shepherd, do not go around condemning … but be a pastor. But is he also a pastor of the excommunicated? Yes, he is the pastor and … he must be a shepherd with God’s style. And God’s style is closeness, compassion, and tenderness.”Neither the Vatican nor the White House has indicated what Biden and the pope might discuss, and the Holy See cancelled its plans to provide a live broadcast of the meeting on Thursday.“My hope is that Biden will have a change of heart both by meeting the Holy Father and by the grace of God,” Rose said. “It’s important that Catholics pray for him and pray for his conversion.”'},\n",

But among those who care about Superman’s sexuality – or would have even noticed it sans the publicity campaign surrounding it – the vast majority will likely be cheering him on.Boldness suggests taking a firm stance outside the mainstream – and Superman’s announcement doesn’t meet the standard there either.If it was, as DC Comics suggested, such a “bold new direction” for the character, shouldn’t it be a direction that drives the conversation forward? Shouldn’t it be a direction that charts a new course and tackles new issues? Shouldn’t it involve risk?Instead it’s just one more character announcing a change that only matters to the increasingly woke critics of an increasingly woke universe.What if, as Cain suggested, Superman battled real injustices like oppressive governments or human trafficking? What if, instead of just checking off the correct boxes and adding his name to the steadily growing cast of LGBTQ+ characters, Superman took a bold stand for gay rights in countries like Iran – where such an offense is often punishable by death?But while Superman’s announcement hardly moves the meter, the outrage mob began to sharpen their knives before Cain had even finished speaking – and most didn’t even register what he actually said.Despite the fact that Cain never said he was “upset” about DC’s announcement – only that he didn’t believe it was “bold or brave” – openly gay “Star Trek” alum George Takei lashed out at Cain as if he had. “So Dean Cain apparently is upset that the new Superboy in the comics is bisexual,” Takei tweeted. “I used to be upset that Dean Cain was straight but he has definitely cured me of that.”So Dean Cain apparently is upset that the new Superboy in the comics is bisexual.I used to be upset that Dean Cain was straight but he has definitely cured me of that.— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 13, 2021Other critics made the same misinterpretation of Cain’s comments – helped along by a headline from The Hollywood Reporter: “Dean Cain Slams Superman Coming Out as Bisexual: ‘It Isn’t Bold or Brave.\\'”Dean Cain Slams Superman Coming Out as Bisexual: “It Isn’t Bold or Brave” https://t.co/Ybg1BagcS9— The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) October 12, 2021The sad irony in all of this, of course, is that Cain is likely to face more backlash for simply voicing his opinion than DC Comics ever will for taking Superman in this “bold new direction.”'},\n",

       "  'full_article_text': 'Editor’s note: What follows is an excerpt from Victor Davis Hanson’s new book “The Dying Citizen:How Progressive Elites, Tribalism, and Globalization Are Destroying the Idea of America.” It can be purchased here.The US Constitution — the foundation of the oldest constitutional republic still in existence today — was primarily designed to protect personal freedom, property, and individual liberty from both oppressive government elites and periodic mob frenzies. The American Revolution, unlike the later French Revolution, was intended neither to ensure mandated equality of result (what we now call “equity”) nor to extend state control over the private lives and thoughts of citizens, much less to create a communitarian ideal of citizenry. Few, if any, of the Founders embraced what the later French Revolutionaries would champion as égalité and fraternité.This American foundational idea of citizen control of government on major matters of life and death, however, is waning. And given that the Constitution is difficult to amend, reformists are constantly seeking evolutionary avenues to render it inert or to change it by unconstitutional means. These “evolutionaries,” who wish to move beyond the Framers’ ideas, assume that the public has lost confidence in its ability to control its own republic or now prefers a radical, equality-of-result democracy to its own prior 234 years of constitutional history.Indeed, rarely in American history have so many powerful and influential Americans become so unhappy with the US Constitution and its emphases on liberty and individual freedom rather than on government-mandated equality. Most critics see the need for a far more powerful presidency to ensure that an obstructionist Congress does not stymie progressive issues such as immigration expansion, climate change, and income redistribution.Political scientist Terry Moe, for example, argues that the Founders “designed a government for a tiny agrarian nation — and they assumed that, as society changed, future generations would change the Constitution to meet new and evolving needs. But future generations didn’t do that. Instead, they put it on a pedestal to be worshipped.” Democracy scholar Larry Diamond has argued that to ensure fairness in American presidential and national elections, we need both to abolish the Electoral College and to adopt ranked-choice voting (RCV), that is, allowing citizens to rank their preferences for multiple candidates, as a way to green-light further changes in how we conduct elections. Of the latter, he argues, “Once RCV is adopted, with its greater incentives to moderation and diversity in our electoral process, other democratic reforms may become more achievable.” Such constitutional critics assume that as the nation constantly becomes more just, fair, and humane — reflecting the natural moral progression of human nature — it also needs to rewrite its charters to improve on the blinkered documents of the late eighteenth century.Of course, throughout American history there have been lots of both necessary and questionable legal and formal attempts to redefine citizenship as set out in the Constitution — well beyond the formal efforts of adding twenty-seven amendments, the last in 1992. Federal and state courts, the administrative state, and presidents wielding sweeping executive orders have all become would-be modernizers. All felt the eighteenth-century Constitution’s singular devotion to liberty hindered the natural progression to an equality of result. And all presidents, on the Left and Right, increasingly feel that executive orders should augment or even replace congressional legislation, especially when a president does not enjoy party majorities in the Congress.Yet never have such efforts of the evolutionaries been so focused and holistic as they are today. Original constitutional avenues for amendments are now often seen as too cumbersome to effect change, given the need for three-quarters of the states to ratify what two-thirds of the Congress has previously enacted. Instead, the subtext for radical reformers remains, why let old white men of a bygone age continue, from their graves, to impose their ossified values on a far more enlightened, ethnically and racially diverse, and knowledgeable twenty-first-century nation? Why not allow a simple majority of Americans or a panel of distinguished jurists to fix what is obviously irrelevant or wrong in the Constitution? After all, the naive and blinkered Founders assumed that human nature is fixed and constant rather than fluid, which — with enough mandated correct education, funding, and technology — would be malleable and subject to radical improvement in its expression.So the latest discussions about “updating” American institutions are not matters of adding a twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, or thirtieth constitutional amendment. Instead, they are far more structural and cover everything from admitting new states to redefining the way we elect presidents. And the efforts represent an assault on the origins, spirit, and current status of our constitutional republic. Progressives no doubt would redefine a citizen, first, as a sort of judge, legislator, and executive through more direct elections and plebiscites and, only second, as a constitutional republican if he does not get his way and needs to fall back on constitutional redress through the courts.The overarching theory of social scientists and historians is the shift from an “equality-of-opportunity” to an “equality-of-outcome” society. This transformation during the New Deal was the requisite for the entire 1960s continuance under the Great Society programs and their redefinition of civil rights to encompass government-ensured economic parity through higher taxes, income redistribution, massive new government spending, and forced proportional representation by race and gender in hiring and admission. Up until then, Americans traditionally had been open to new and stronger laws protecting equality of opportunity but were wary of the destructiveness of envy, the ancient fuel of an equality-of-result society that saw government punish its more successful citizens. As Alexis de Tocqueville warned of upward mobility and the resentment it incurs in a democracy, “In a democracy private citizens see a man of their own rank in life who becomes possessed of riches and power in a few years; this spectacle excites their surprise and envy, and they are led to inquire how the person who was yesterday their equal is today their ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents or his virtues is unpleasant; for it is tacitly to acknowledge that they are themselves less virtuous and less talented than he was.”As we will see, the mostly elite and formal efforts to change the Constitution — whether by systematically nullifying federal laws, using the courts and the bureaucracy to circumvent the will of Congress, or ignoring or replacing parts of the Constitution itself — share the same ideological geneses that have led to the ad hoc diminution of the middle class, the conflation of citizenship with residency, and the multicultural tribalism discussed previously. The common theme once more is an effort to erode traditions and laws in order to mandate equity and to empower an alliance of the elite and the poor at the expense of the power and influence of the middle class.Excerpted from “The Dying Citizen:How Progressive Elites, Tribalism, and Globalization Are Destroying the Idea of America” by Victor Davis Hanson.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Hunter Biden continues to hold a minority stake in a Chinese private equity firm that invested in a technology company that was sanctioned in 2019 for committing human rights violations against Uyghurs.President Joe Biden promised in October 2019 during his campaign that nobody in his family would have any business relationship with any foreign corporation or country if he won the White House. The president reiterated his promise in December 2020 after his election victory, saying his son would “not be involved in any business, any enterprise that is in conflict with or appears to be in conflict with an appropriate distance from the presidency and government. ”“No one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will, in fact, have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,” Joe Biden said in October 2019. “Period. Period. End of story.”Despite his father’s promises, Hunter Biden continues to hold a 10% equity stake in the Chinese equity firm, BHR Partners, through his company, Skaneateles LLC, according to business records accessed Monday from China’s National Credit Information Publicity System.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in early February that Hunter Biden was in the process of divesting his ownership stake in BHR Partners, which he obtained with a $420,000 investment in October 2017.Psaki told reporters Monday that Hunter Biden was still in the process of winding down his investment in the firm and directed further questions to his representatives.It’s not clear if Hunter Biden expects to receive a return on his investment in BHR Partners after his divestment is complete.Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, has not returned numerous inquiries from the Daily Caller News Foundation.BHR is co-owned by the Chinese state-controlled Bank of China, its business records show, and manages the equivalent of $2.1 billion in assets, according to its website.The same month Hunter Biden purchased his 10% stake in BHR Partners, the private equity firm purchased a stake in the Chinese facial recognition company Megvii, which was later sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2019 for its alleged involvement in implementing “China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.”President-elect Joe Biden embraces his son Hunter Biden after addressing the nation from the Chase Center on November 07, 2020, in Wilmington, Delaware.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Colorado Rep. Ken Buck is leading the charge among Republican lawmakers to break up Big Tech, co-sponsoring six bipartisan antitrust bills set to hit the House floor next month.Following the conclusion of a 16-month investigation\\xa0by the House Judiciary Committee into anticompetitive conduct by major tech companies, Buck, who serves as Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, helped lead the drafting and introduction of a series of bills aimed at addressing Big Tech’s perceived monopoly power.The bills target Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and aim to create greater competition in digital markets as well as protect consumers by increasing data portability, making it harder for tech companies to acquire competitors, and preventing platforms from prioritizing their own services. If passed, the bills would be by far the most substantial pieces of legislation governing social media platforms, and would significantly alter the ways in which tech companies do business. (RELATED: Rep. Ken Buck Demands Clarification From Apple CEO Over Alleged Forced Labor Ties In China)While Buck oversaw the passage of the legislation out of the House Judiciary Committee in June, the bills have yet to see the House floor, prompting some frustration\\xa0and concern amid lawmakers. Buck told the Daily Caller News Foundation he’s pleased with the bills’ progress, especially considering Congress’s chaotic last few months.Rep. Ken Buck questions officials during the House impeachment hearings. (Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)“I don’t agree that the bills have stalled; I think this is exactly what the legislative process should look like,” Buck said. “When you’re dealing with fundamental changes in the law like these bills propose, it’s a good thing that we’re taking time.” (RELATED: Arizona Senate Candidate Blake Masters Plans To Tackle Big Tech’s ‘Predatory’ Business Practices)The bills enjoy strong bipartisan support, with Republicans such as Reps. Madison Cawthorn, Burgess Owens and Lance Gooden and top House Democrats such as Reps. David Cicilline and Pramila Jayapal throwing their weight behind the antitrust package.However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have also voiced their concerns. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republican Rep. Jim Jordan view the legislation as not adequately addressing problems of political censorship, while several moderate Democrats attempted to stall committee action on the bills due to potential “unintended consequences” in digital markets. (RELATED: How Can Antitrust Lawsuits Against Big Tech Succeed?)Buck told the DCNF he views the bills as encouraging “grassroots” antitrust enforcement, in which states are empowered to act as enforcers. The State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act, which Buck sponsored, allows for state attorneys general to remain in the court they select during an antitrust lawsuit, preventing the case from being moved to courts more favorable to Big Tech.“As a very strong supporter of federalism I think the state attorneys general see a lot at the ground level that Congress, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice don’t,” Buck said. “It’s important that we have this grassroots enforcement mechanism, and what we’ve done is give the state attorneys general the same ability to choose their venue as the federal government.”House Judiciary Committee member Rep. David Cicilline talks with Chairman Jerry Nadler during a hearing on Feb. 8, 2019. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Buck said he approved of recent antitrust challenges to major tech companies brought by state attorneys general, such as the complaint\\xa0led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton against Google in December 2020, and saw the bill as a way to help similar lawsuits be filed in the future. Buck also said he viewed state-level legislation targeting tech companies, such as Florida’s social media law\\xa0and California’s data privacy rules, as a way forward.“States are the laboratories of innovation,” Buck said. “Addressing Big Tech is really just another example of what states have done very successfully.”Despite favoring a more state-level, federalized approach to antitrust enforcement, Buck said he still sees a place for the FTC and DOJ. While several top Republicans who have been active in proposing antitrust legislation targeting Big Tech, such as Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Jim Jordan, have raised concerns\\xa0over further empowering the FTC, Buck argued that aggressive federal antitrust enforcement is long overdue.“What has happened in the marketplace is that these companies have become so enormous that they’re gobbling up these small competitors, sometimes putting them on the shelf so they don’t have a competitor and sometimes integrating the new technology into their platforms,” Buck told the DCNF. “I think there were around 750 mergers in the technology industry that went unchallenged, and that’s really the origins of the fundamental problems we’re seeing today.”Buck told the DCNF the bills would help address these fundamental problems. (RELATED: Breaking Up Big Tech Tech Could ‘Degrade’ Innovation And Give China The Upper Hand, Former National Security Officials Warn)“We can see today in Instagram, WhatsApp, or Youtube the results of mergers six or seven years ago,” he said. “But it’s almost impossible for the FTC or DOJ to address those problems in a court of law.”Indeed, several of the bills Buck co-sponsored directly empower antitrust enforcement agencies to restructure tech companies.U.S. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confer during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill March 19, 2013 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)The Ending Platform Monopolies Act\\xa0would enable the FTC to spin off or eliminate certain products or services that create “conflicts of interest” for major tech platforms. For example, the bill could force Amazon to discontinue selling Amazon Basics\\xa0products on its online marketplace.Similarly, the Platform Competition and Opportunity Act\\xa0would prevent platforms with more than 50 million monthly active users in the U.S. from holding more than 25% of a competitor’s stock. The bill could potentially outlaw future acquisitions of smaller competitors by large tech companies, a practice Facebook was sued\\xa0for in December by the FTC.Buck also differs from several high-profile Republican politicians such as Sen. Josh Hawley on solutions to political censorship by social media companies, viewing biased content moderation as a problem of inadequate competition. Buck said the issue of censorship should be tackled with stronger competition laws, and sees the antitrust bills as a step in the right direction.“I am very concerned about the federal government getting involved in defining appropriate speech,” Buck said. “If we have five Facebooks we’ll address the speech issue better than having some government censor decide what is appropriate or dangerous.”Buck told the DCNF he expects the bills to hit the House floor in November. Lawmakers in the Senate, including Republicans Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, and Chuck Grassley, and Democrats such as Amy Klobuchar, are working\\xa0to draft companion legislation to the antitrust package.Klobuchar and Sen. Mike Lee advanced a companion bill to Buck’s State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in late September. Recent reports\\xa0indicate the Senate’s version of the other antitrust bills will not be identical to those advanced in the House.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images)“These Big Tech monopolies know exactly how addictive and manipulative their products are but they’re content to rake in billions by exploiting children,” Hawley said.Hawley’s Big Tech efforts\\xa0have largely centered on empowering individuals through establishing a private right of action. The Missouri Senator previously introduced several bills seeking to address perceived market abuses and censorship of conservatives by Big Tech, proposing\\xa0a bill in 2019 that would strip Section 230 liability protections from tech companies that failed to adhere to standards of political neutrality.Thursday’s bill aims to empower parents of children harmed by social media. (RELATED: Arizona Senate Candidate Blake Masters Plans To Tackle Big Tech’s ‘Predatory’ Business Practices)“Parents need to be given the tools to take back control,” Hawley said.While Congress has so far floundered on comprehensive Section 230 reform, there has been a recent flurry of bipartisan support\\xa0to address social media companies’ harmful effects on users, especially children. There is also a bipartisan antitrust effort\\xa0in both the House and Senate, with growing concern from both parties over the size and power of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple.Democrats have also taken aim at Section 230, albeit for much different reasons, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar introducing\\xa0legislation in July that would allow individuals to sue social media companies that promote medical misinformation.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Peter DeFazio in a much safer 4th district but puts Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader in a slightly more competitive one. But while Schrader could face several competitive elections, his new district includes Bend, the fastest-growing city in the state, meaning that his swingy 5th district could trend solidly Democratic over the coming decade.\\xa0(RELATED: Here Are The States Gaining, Losing Congressional Seats This Decade)Oregon is one of the few states where Democrats had an opportunity to increase their share of seats since most other states gaining them, like Texas, Florida and North Carolina, are controlled by Republicans.While the National Democratic Redistricting Committee called the new maps “a compromise that accurately reflects the makeup of the state as a whole,” according to Oregon Public Broadcasting, Republicans disagreed.“The law requires us to keep communities of interest together in the redistricting process,” said Oregon Senate Minority Leader Fred Girod. “The only community of interest this map seeks to keep together are Democrat voters.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Unsealed Invoices Show Planned Parenthood Billed A Tissue Company Nearly $25K For Fetal Body Parts)“I’ve been doing this for 23 years. These documents we’ve gotten from the FDA and our other lawsuit…they are the worst things I’ve ever seen,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told the Daily Caller News Foundation Friday. “The most troubling documents I’ve ever seen.”In a Friday statement to the DCNF, the FDA did not deny purchasing the unborn baby body parts and downplayed its use of human fetal tissue, saying it was only used in situations “critical to understanding the safety of drugs and vaccines and in which it couldn’t be feasibly achieved through another means.”“Since 2018, the FDA has not entered into any contracts for the purchase of human fetal tissue,” the FDA told the DCNF, adding that “prior research involving human fetal tissue accounted for a very small fraction of the FDA’s total research.”Judicial Watch obtained the communications, which span 2012 and 2013, through a 2019 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (RELATED: Planned Parenthood Employee Testified She Wanted To ‘Move Forward’ On Selling Fetal Livers For $750 Each)The lawsuit asked for all communications and documentation between the FDA and the human fetal tissue provider Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) related to human fetal tissue intended for use in humanized mice research — a process in which researchers implant undeveloped human tissue cells into living mice.A federal court then ordered HHS to release more information about aborted fetal tissue harvesting and said “there is reason to question” whether the transactions violate federal law, which bans the sale of fetal organs, according to Judicial Watch.Fetal tissue has been used\\xa0in a number of\\xa0research projects\\xa0looking for cures and treatments including Alzheimer’s, spinal cord injury, eye disease and HIV, but religious and pro-life advocates argue the practice is unethical since the fetal tissue comes from aborted babies.\\xa0(RELATED: Is Fetal Tissue Research Vital To Medicine? Here’s What The Experts Say)Under former President Donald Trump’s administration, HHS conducted\\xa0a nine-month review of government-funded research involving\\xa0fetal tissue from elective abortions, culminating in HHS banning the NIH internal research team from using fetal tissue in July 2019.President Joe Biden’s administration reversed this ban in April.“So now the Biden FDA is defending chopping up the parts of unborn human beings to create vaccines,” Fitton said to the DCNF. “Is that their position?”“What they don’t tell you,” he continued, “is that the funding was cut off under Trump. And it was announced earlier this year by the Biden administration that the spigot was going to be turned back on again.”HOUSTON, TX – FEBRUARY 04: David Daleiden, a defendant in an indictment stemming from a Planned Parenthood video he helped produce, speaks to the media after appearing in court at the Harris County Courthouse on February 4, 2016 in Houston, Texas. (Photo by Eric Kayne/Getty Images)“There are few Americans who would support chopping up the remains of unborn human beings for scientific research, using their organs, selling their heads for whatever Frankenstein experiments, the FDA and their researchers want to cook up,” Fitton said told the DCNF. “It’s barbarism. There should be a criminal investigation to figure out whether the laws against profiteering for fetal organ trafficking were violated as a court suggested they may have been.”The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has repeatedly defended itself from accusations that it sells fetal tissue. The organization publicly acknowledged that they were paid for fetal tissue but said that they were only reimbursed for costs, then subsequently said they would no longer accept even reimbursements.Pro-life activists like David Daleiden have previously noted that some unborn babies may have cardiac activity when their organs are harvested, suggesting the babies may have still been alive.

The commission also ruled that there was “no information that Twitter coordinated” with the Biden campaign in censoring the story.

FEC Deputy Press Officer Christian Hilland declined to comment to the Daily Caller News Foundation when asked for a copy of the decision.“Once an enforcement matter is resolved, the FEC has up to 30 days to post the related documents on our website,” Hilland said.There is no evidence that the New York Post obtained the “smoking gun” email, which Hunter Biden received in April 2015 from an executive of a Ukrainian gas company discussing an introduction to then-Vice President Joe Biden, from a hack.Hunter Biden has never addressed the authenticity of a 2019 repair quote\\xa0containing his signature authorizing a Delaware computer repair shop to move data from his Macbook Pro to a store server.The owner of the repair shop said he provided the contents of the laptop’s hard drive to a lawyer for former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani after Hunter Biden failed to retrieve his computer. The repair shop owner also said federal authorities seized the laptop in December 2019.A cybersecurity expert told the DCNF in October that the email at the center of the New York Post’s story is unquestionably authentic. The expert, Robert Graham, was able to test the DKIM signature within the email’s metadata against a private key on Google’s servers, proving the email’s legitimacy.Hunter Biden told CBS in April that he does not remember dropping his laptop off at the Delaware computer repair shop in 2019, but added that the device “certainly” could be his.Hunter Biden revealed in December that federal prosecutors in Delaware were investigating his “tax affairs.”Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies during a House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on Capitol Hill, September 5, 2018, in Washington, DC.(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told lawmakers during a congressional hearing on misinformation and social media in March that he regrets censoring the New York Post and its story.“We recognize it as a mistake that we made, both in terms of the intention of the policy and also the enforcement action of not allowing people to share it publicly or privately,” Dorsey said.RNC spokeswoman Emma Vaughn told the Times that it was “weighing its options for appealing this disappointing decision from the FEC.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The mandate will remain in place until Sept. 15.Warren, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation, repeatedly emphasized the importance of wearing masks throughout the first year of the pandemic.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Mississippi’s Attorney General Lynn Fitch called on the Supreme Court Thursday to defend the right of states to pass laws protecting “life and women’s health,” urging the court to overturn the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade.The attorney general filed a brief in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which the court will hear beginning in October, slamming Roe as “egregiously wrong” and calling on the Supreme Court to uphold Mississippi’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks.Dobbs will be the first major abortion case in which all three of former President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court justice appointees participate, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who gained a seat on the court after a contentious confirmation\\xa0process in October.At issue is the question of whether all pre-viability bans on abortions are unconstitutional. (RELATED: Supreme Court Takes Up Major Abortion Case Directly Challenging Roe v. Wade)“There are those who would like to believe that Roe v. Wade settled the issue of abortion once and for all,” Fitch said in a statement. “But all it did was establish a special-rules regime for abortion jurisprudence that has left these cases out of step with other Court decisions and neutral principles of law applied by the Court.”“As a result, state legislatures, and the people they represent, have lacked clarity in passing laws to protect legitimate public interests, and artificial guideposts have stunted important public debate on how we, as a society, care for the dignity of women and their children,” Fitch continued. “It is time for the Court to set this right and return this political debate to the political branches of government.”The brief argues that many things have changed in the nearly 50 years since Roe v. Wade, including scientific understanding of when an unborn baby is viable outside the womb. (RELATED: States Introduced Over 500 Pro-Life Bills In 2021 In ‘Pro-Life Surge’)An unborn baby is\\xa0considered viable\\xa0at 24 weeks, though medical intervention and a stay in the NICU are usually required this early. Babies born before 23 weeks\\xa0have a survival rate\\xa0of about 5% to 6%, and analysis by Charlotte Lozier Institute medical experts found that unborn babies\\xa0can feel pain as early as 12 weeks.“Legislatures should be able to respond to those advances, which they cannot do in the face of flawed precedents that are anchored to decades-stale views of life and health,” the brief said.“A lot has changed in five decades,” Fitch said in a statement. “In 1973, there was little support for women who wanted a full family life and a successful career. Maternity leave was rare. Paternity leave was unheard of. The gold standard for professional success was a 9-to-5 with a corner office. The flexibility of the gig economy was a fairy tale.”“In these last fifty years,” she continued, “women have carved their own way to achieving a better balance for success in their professional and personal lives. By returning the matter of abortion policy to state legislatures, we allow a stunted debate on how we support women to flourish. It is time for the Court to let go of its hold on this important debate.”Center for Reproductive Rights president Nancy Northup condemned the move, saying in a statement that Fitch’s brief “reveals the extreme and regressive strategy, not just of this law, but of the avalanche of abortion bans and restrictions that are being passed across the country.”\\xa0“The other side isn’t even hiding their true goal anymore,” tweeted the National Abortion Rights Action League. “They want to overturn Roe, and now they’re saying it explicitly. Our most fundamental freedom is on the line.”Pro-life groups were quick to praise Fitch’s filing, noting, as Americans United for Life president and CEO Catherine Glenn Foster said in a statement, that “the States and the People should decide the controversial and highly politicized question of abortion, not a majority of nine unelected Justices on the Supreme Court.”Just read AG Fitch’s brief in the Dobbs late term abortion case.It makes it clear SCOTUS’ abortion jurisprudence is hopelessly unworkable and ungrounded in history or facts.It is long overdue for the Supreme Court to let the abortion debate move forward democratically.— MarjorieDannenfelser (@marjoriesba)\\xa0July 22, 2021 \\xa0“The millions of precious lives lost based on the false premise of a constitutional right to abortion is undeniable. Now is the time for Roe to join Dred Scott v. Sanford in the dustbin of history where it belongs,” Foster said.March for Life president Jeanne Mancini also said in a statement the brief makes clear that “updating America’s abortion jurisprudence is necessary and long overdue.”“Limiting gruesome late term abortions is compassionate and\\xa0popular,” Mancini said, “and the norm in countries that have allowed their laws to catch up with the science. Sadly, right now, the United States is one of only seven countries – including North Korea and China – that\\xa0allow\\xa0elective abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Other reports have attributed polls’ growing inaccuracy to Republicans’ unwillingness to participate in them, exacerbated by former President Donald Trump repeatedly labeling any surveys he did not like as “fake.”Presidential polls in the final two weeks before the election were off by about 4.5 points, the report said, while state polls were off by just over five. While President Joe Biden’s support was only overestimated by about a point, Trump’s was underestimated by over three.The task force behind the report observed 2,858 polls, of which 529 were of the national presidential race and 1,572 were of the race at state levels.\\xa0(RELATED: Top Pollsters Detail What They Think Led Them To Blow The 2020 Election)Then-President Donald Trump and now-President Joe Biden debate in Cleveland. Polls showed Biden’s lead widen following it. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)Voters’ growing unwillingness to participate makes polls’ inaccuracy far harder to diagnose than in 2016, when the AAPOR’s report found that many polls — and especially those in critical swing states — failed to weigh results by education, and therefore vastly underestimated Trump’s popularity among voters without a college degree.Voters in 2016 also showed dissatisfaction with both Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and over 6% of the electorate cast their ballot for a third-party candidate. In 2020, however, over 98% of voters chose either Trump or Biden.The possible lack of participation among Trump’s supporters also led to overestimating Democratic support nationwide.“There was a systematic error that was found in terms of the overstatement for Democratic support across the board,” Josh Clinton said. “It didn’t matter what type of poll you were doing, whether you’re interviewing by phone or Internet or whatever. And it didn’t matter what type of race, whether President Trump was on the ballot or was not on the ballot.”Overestimation of Democrats was especially apparent in down-ballot races. Democrats were widely expected to gain seats in the House and potentially flip several state legislatures ahead of the decennial redistricting, but Republicans ultimately gained 12 in the House and held every state legislature.\\xa0(RELATED: Republicans Won Critical Elections Where Trump Failed)Experts’ failure to reach a conclusion as to why the polls were so far off also raised concerns over polling’s accuracy in 2022 and 2024.“How certain are we that we can fix this in the future? Well, it’s unclear,” Josh Clinton said. “We’ll have to wait and see what happens — which isn’t a particularly reassuring position. But I think that’s the honest answer.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In defense of the unity of the Body of Christ, I am constrained to revoke the faculty granted by my Predecessors.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Multiple parents have filed lawsuits against Washington, D.C., for allowing children to receive vaccines without parental knowledge or consent.In a lawsuit filed Monday by the Children’s Health Defense (CHD) and Parental Rights Foundation against D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, four parents call for a preliminary injunction prohibiting D.C. from enforcing the D.C. Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2020, which allows children who are eleven-years-old or older deemed “capable of meeting the informed consent standard” to consent to vaccines without their parents’ knowledge or consent.“The Minor Consent Act subverts the right and duty of parents to make informed decisions about whether their children should receive vaccinations, by both depriving them of the opportunity to make those decisions and by concealing from parents that their children have been asked to consent to vaccinations or may have indeed been vaccinated,” the lawsuit said. “In fact, the Minor Consent Act states that medical providers who administer vaccines under the Minor Consent Act shall seek reimbursement directly from the insurer without parental knowledge or consent.”Bowser’s office declined to comment on the matter to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: DC Archbishop Sues Mayor Muriel Bowser For ‘Arbitrary, Unscientific And Discriminatory’ Restrictions Ahead Of Christmas)“We do not comment on pending litigation,” DC Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development John Falcicchio said Wednesday.“Providers who administer immunizations under the authority of this subsection shall seek reimbursement, without parental consent, directly from the insurer, which may be Medicaid, Alliance, or private insurance,” the Minor Consent Act said. “The provider shall notify the insurer that the immunization has been provided under the authority of this section.”All of the parents named in the lawsuit object to the COVID-19 vaccine on religious grounds. Some of the parents formerly obtained childhood vaccines for their children and have since “formed sincere religious objections to vaccinations.”This is not the first lawsuit of its kind. Joshua Mazer, the father of a 16-year-old daughter, also filed a lawsuit July 2 against Bowser in her capacity as D.C. mayor. Mazer and his daughter reside in Maryland but his daughter traveled to the MedStar Georgetown Pediatrics without her parents and requested a vaccine, according to the lawsuit.The father cited both medical and religious reasons for why he objected to his daughter receiving the vaccine, asserting that the Minor Consent Act “creates an entire structure by which the health care provider, insurance company, school, and health department all engage in an elaborate and deceitful scheme, including lying to the parents, to hide from those parents the fact that their child was vaccinated without parental notification, control, or consent, and all without any finding that a parent is unfit.”WASHINGTON, DC – JUNE 11: Washington DC Mayor Murial Bowser participates in a virtual meeting with Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci at the Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus on June 11, 2021 in Washington, DC. Fauci spoke on the urgency to get all eligible individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Mazer said his daughter had previously suffered a “severe reaction to a tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis-containing vaccine” when she was five-years-old, requiring “urgent medical treatment,” according to the lawsuit. A pediatric allergy and immunology specialist wrote a special exemption for Mazer’s daughter from receiving more doses of the pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, according to the lawsuit, which noted that Mazer’s daughter “did not understand that her previous reaction was an allergic reaction.”When Mazer’s daughter went to MedStar Georgetown Pediatrics to obtain the vaccine, she presented her mother’s insurance card, gave her date of birth, told the hospital that her parents were not with her, and “explained that she wanted to attend a summer camp and needed to receive a vaccine to do same and that her parents would not consent to her receiving this vaccine,” according to the lawsuit.Dr. Nneka Holder was told that Mazer’s daughter was there without her parents’ knowledge or consent to get the vaccine, the lawsuit said, and Holder and the nurses reportedly congratulated the 16-year-old for “sneaking behind her parents back.”The doctor and nurses also convinced Mazer’s daughter to get the vaccine products Gardasil and MenACWY, the lawsuit said. Holder reportedly encouraged the 16-year-old to return for a further Gardasil booster and “coached” her on “lying in relation to receiving the shots.” (RELATED: DC Mayor Sued Over Arrest Of Advocates Who Wrote Pro-Life Messages On Sidewalk)“After an hour and a half of complexity surrounding getting the shots without alerting her parents, the vaccines were finally brought into J.D.’s treating room,” the lawsuit said. “J.D. became nervous upon seeing the shots and voiced that she wanted to leave without getting the shots. At that point, the doctor and nurse positioned themselves in the room such that she felt trapped. After further dialogue and repeating that she no longer wanted the shots, J.D. was able to leave without getting the shots.”“During her lengthy visit, J.D. was told the vaccines are safe, nothing more,” the lawsuit continued. “She was not provided a VIS (a vaccine information statement) nor any other written information about these products. At no time did anyone ask J.D. whether, for example, she had severe pain or swelling after a previous dose of any vaccine, nor any of the other medical conditions listed on the VIS that parents are told to inform their health care providers about before their child is vaccinated.”The lawsuit also emphasized that Holder and the nurses did not try to obtain information from Mazer’s daughter about her previous reactions to vaccines “despite the fact that this was the first time they had ever met her and had no information about her medical history.”MedStar Georgetown did not respond to requests for comment from the DCNF.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The former Maxwell attorney said that the government asked that the court “issue an order pursuant to Local Rule 23.1(h)” directed at Markus. (RELATED: Pennsylvania Supreme Court Overturns Bill Cosby’s Sexual Assault Conviction)“The Pennsylvania Supreme Court did the right thing when it threw out Bill Cosby’s convictions because prosecutors cheated,” Markus wrote in the June 30 op-ed.The former Maxwell attorney argued that prosecutors had promised Cosby they wouldn’t prosecute him if he testified in civil cases against him, but then broke their promise and “used Cosby’s statements in those depositions to win a conviction against him.”The opinion and reasoning in Cosby’s case “applies directly to Ghislaine Maxwell’s case,” Markus said, noting that “Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty and struck a bargain with the prosecutors in Miami” and “in exchange for pleading guilty in state court, the U.S. attorney’s office agreed that it would not prosecute any of his alleged co-conspirators.”“Despite its promise not to go after Maxwell, federal prosecutors in New York brought a federal case against her after Epstein died, arguing that it does not need to live up to the deal struck by federal prosecutors in Miami,” he wrote. “But that reasoning makes no sense. We have one federal government, and the agreement says clearly that the United States would not prosecute Maxwell.”In the Friday court filing, Markus argued that his op-ed did not break any rules. The piece did not present any risk of “danger or prejudice” to Maxwell’s upcoming trial because the op-ed’s argument was already filed in public pleadings previously quoted by the media and did not disclose any confidential information, Markus said.UNSPECIFIED, FL – JULY 25. 2013: In this handout provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Jeffrey Epstein poses for a sex offender mugshot after being charged with procuring a minor for prostitution on July 25, 2013 in Florida. (Photo by Florida Department of Law Enforcement via Getty Images)The former Maxwell attorney also argued that Maxwell, her family, and their counsel “have the right to respond to the numerous lawyers, witnesses, and surrogates who are speaking to the press and making it impossible for Ms. Maxwell to receive a fair trial.” (RELATED: Address Book Found On NYC Sidewalk Appears To Show More Connections Of Convicted Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein)“The press has been unrelenting and overwhelmingly prejudicial in its coverage of Ms. Maxwell and her family, fueled by statements from involved parties about the matters at issue,” he continued. “It is not an understatement to say that 99.9% of the press coverage is pro-government and anti-Maxwell.“The press has already tried and convicted he,” Markus said. “And the Government has done nothing to control its surrogates, which has only made the problem worse.”He asked: “How can Ms. Maxwell be expected to receive a fair trial when lawyers for the accusers are holding press conferences, leaking information, and otherwise making wholly inappropriate comments to the press?”Markus also argued that the government has created a “totally unlevel playing field” for Maxwell through “blowups, photographs, soundbites, inflammatory language, and strategic pauses to get the most impactful photo opportunity.” These are strategies designed to “stir up the press” and “inflame the passions of the public,” he wrote.“And it worked,” the former Maxwell attorney added.

As of Tuesday afternoon, only one of the six, Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, expressed support for the right of the Cuban people to protest. He added that the communist Cuban government needs to respect those rights.Calling “on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence,” Sanders said in a tweet that “all people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society.”All people have the right to protest and to live in a democratic society. I call on the Cuban government to respect opposition rights and refrain from violence. It’s also long past time to end the unilateral U.S. embargo on Cuba, which has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people.— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) July 13, 2021Though he acknowledged the rights of the Cuban people, Sanders blamed the U.S.’s long-standing embargo on Cuba for exacerbating the shortages, claiming that it “has only hurt, not helped, the Cuban people.”Furthermore, a State Department official cited medical shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic, not opposition to the communist government, as the cause of the protests. Protesters chanted, “Cuba isn’t yours,” outside of the Communist Party’s headquarters.Throughout his political career, Sanders has expressed support for Cuba’s communist government, particularly longtime strongman dictator Fidel Castro, who died in 2016. “I did not see a hungry child. I did not see any homeless people. Cuba today not only has free health care but very high-quality health care,” he said in 1989, when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont.Sanders reportedly told an American aid worker imprisoned in Cuba, “I don’t see what’s so wrong with this country,” in 2014.Sanders shared similar sentiments in February 2020, at the heat of the Democratic presidential primaries. “When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?” Sanders said in a 60 Minutes interview after a video of him praising Castro in 1985 surfaced. (RELATED: Bernie Claims He Spent Lifetime ‘Fighting Against Authoritarianism’)It could be, at least at this time, Sanders’ defense of the Cuban people’s right to protest was more than other left-wing members could muster.Five Democrats, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, and New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, have not issued statements of support for the protests. All five consider themselves socialists or have associated themselves with DSA.DSA’s International Committee tweeted that it “stands with the Cuban people and their Revolution in this moment of unrest,” and urged the United States to “end the blockade.” The main DSA Twitter account called for the embargo to end, “full stop.”DSA stands with the Cuban people and their Revolution in this moment of unrest.

It was when he dismissed and didn’t act on the very powerful Horowitz Report, and instead gave everything over to John Durham, who has seemingly disappeared from the planet.”Trump went on to criticize Barr personally, calling him a RINO and a “swamp creature.” (RELATED: Trump’s Top Lawyer In Wisconsin Is Arguing His Own Vote Was Illegal)“Barr was a ‘swamp creature’ who was devastated when the Radical Left wanted to impeach him,” he continued. “Despite evidence of tremendous Election Fraud, he just didn’t want to go there.

But my suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.”Prior to the election, Barr had been one of the most prominent voices warning of the dangers of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Specifically, Barr warned that universal mail-in balloting had never been tried and could pose great risk. Ultimately, only nine states and the District of Columbia used universal mail-in balloting and only one of those states, Nevada, faced contention from the Trump campaign regarding its result. The lawsuit failed in court, however.The Atlantic article centered on a December 2020 meeting between Trump and Barr at the White House shortly after Barr had told The Associated Press (AP) that the FBI and other organizations hadn’t uncovered any evidence of fraud that could have overturned the result of the election.“Did you say that?” Trump reportedly asked Barr regarding the AP report.“Yes,” Barr responded.“How the f-ck could you do this to me?

Not only is this decision a stunning rejection of our constitutional values and protestors’ First Amendment rights, but it effectively places federal officials above the law,” he continued.Friedrich did permit the challenges against the Arlington Police Department and Metropolitan Police Department to continue. Officers from both department’s were involved in the clearing of the park.“As alleged, the defendants prohibited all expressive activities in Lafayette Square without any basis at all; they left open no alternative channels; and they forcibly dispersed protestors because of the plaintiffs’ exercise of their protected First Amendment rights. Reasonable officers would have known that such alleged actions violated clearly established law.”Interior Department Inspector General Mark Greenblatt issued a report finding Park Police were given the green light to clear protesters from the park prior to anyone knowing Trump was going to walk over to the church. The park was cleared so anti-scale fencing could be installed following riots, Greenblatt wrote, according to NBC News. (RELATED: Legacy Media Suffers A Hit As Yet Another Trump Conspiracy Theory Evaporates)“We determined that the evidence did not support a finding that the (Park Police) cleared the park on June 1, 2020, so that then President Trump could enter the park.”Greenblatt did note there was miscommunication among officials in terms of clearing the park, claiming Barr pushed for the clearing to be sped up after he learned of Trump’s plans to walk to St. Johns Church.'},\n",

Others\\xa0suggest\\xa0that the Catholic sentiment is changing due to public opinion on these topics — though Catholic teaching has not changed.The Catholic Church teaches that Catholics\\xa0may not receive Holy Communion if they are “conscious of a grave sin.” Catholics who have committed any grave sins must make a good confession before they can receive, according to the church.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': \"A major radio network that produces shows for prominent conservative hosts appointed a Media Matters director to its own board in 2018. Since then, the network has escaped the ire of the liberal media watchdog group known for its efforts to defund and cancel conservatives.Investment fund manager Tom Castro, who has served as a Media Matters director since 2013, joined the Cumulus Media board in early 2018. Media Matters mentioned Cumulus in at least 160 articles prior to Castro joining the radio network’s board; since then, Media Matters has mentioned the word “Cumulus” in just three articles, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation review.Cumulus is one of the largest radio companies in the nation, boasting that its content reaches over a quarter billion people every month. The company owns 415 stations across the country, and delivers content to nearly 7,300 affiliated stations through its subsidiary Westwood One.Cumulus produces daily talk shows for prominent conservative commentators that are often targeted by Media Matters, including Mark Levin, Ben Shapiro, Dan Bongino and Michael Knowles.While Media Matters has covered Westwood One’s conservative talent during Castro’s simultaneous tenure on the two organizations’ boards, the media watchdog group has spared Cumulus from the types of advertiser boycotts it has recently organized against Fox News.Media Matters reported in May that any advertiser that sponsors Fox News puts their brand “in danger.” A month prior, the watchdog group reported that “every Fox News advertiser bears responsibility” for host Tucker Carlson’s “vile rhetoric.”Media Matters also launched the “Drop Fox” campaign in early 2021 explicitly calling on major brands to stop buying ads on the network. The group has also operated the “UnFox My Cable Box” campaign since at least 2019 to pressure television providers to stop paying subscriber fees to Fox News.While Media Matters did publish a story in January about Cumulus asking their conservative hosts to cease spreading election misinformation, the story contained no insinuation that Cumulus advertisers bear responsibility for the election misinformation spread by Cumulus hosts. In fact, the story did not make any mention of Cumulus advertisers whatsoever.Media Matters Fox Studios Mobile Billboard Activation at Darryl Zanuck Theater at FOX Studios on November 14, 2019, in Los Angeles, California. (Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Media Matters for America)As part of its extensive coverage of Fox News, Media Matters often frames comments made on Cumulus-produced radio shows as being the responsibility of the television network.For example, Media Matters has published at least 15 stories since late 2019 covering comments “Fox host” Mark Levin made on his radio show produced by Cumulus subsidiary Westwood One, a review of the Media Matters website shows.While the Media Matters stories about Levin do disclose that his comments came from his radio show and not his Sunday evening Fox News show, the headline, framing and featured image of the stories often give the impression that Fox News bears responsibility for the comments.Since Castro joined the Cumulus board, Media Matters stories covering the radio network and its Westwood One subsidiary haven’t used threatening language against Cumulus advertisers that the watchdog group often includes in its coverage of Fox News, despite leveraging comments made on Cumulus properties as part of its anti-Fox crusade.That wasn’t always the case, however. In 2012, Media Matters organized an advertiser boycott campaign against the late radio host Rush Limbaugh that targeted a number of radio networks including Cumulus, which carried Limbaugh on around 40 of its 570 stations at the time. In a story promoting the campaign, Media Matters said that advertisers and radio executives “are realizing that associating with Rush Limbaugh is bad for business.”Media Matters mentioned the financial consequence Cumulus faced as a result of the Limbaugh boycott campaign in at least eight stories in 2012. In one story calling Cumulus a “Limbaugh affiliate,” Media Matters reported that the boycott cost the radio network millions in lost revenue.Media Matters spokeswoman Laura Keiter told the DCNF in an email that the group has “written more, not less, content critical of Cumulus/Westwood One hosts in the 4 years following 2018 than the 3 years prior.”“If you think we’re in the tank for Cumulus, go ask Mark Levin or Dan Bongino whether they think the researchers assigned to listen to their shows are going easy on them. The last time Media Matters wrote about Cumulus, the article’s headline was ‘Cumulus Media hosts continue to spread election misinformation after being told to stop.'”Keiter did not respond to a follow-up email asking why Media Matters hasn’t targeted Cumulus or Westwood One with advertiser boycotts similar to those it has launched against Fox News during Castro’s dual tenure on the Media Matters and Cumulus boards.It’s unclear if Castro’s position on the Media Matters board was a factor in his appointment to the Cumulus board of directors in early 2018. Cumulus did not return a request for comment.

One of the radio companies he founded ended up growing into one of the largest privately-owned radio companies in the U.S. He now serves as the founder and CEO of the Houston-based investment firm El Dorado Capital.Cumulus is not upfront about Castro’s involvement with Media Matters. The radio network states on its website that Castro “has been active in civic affairs nationally” and that he “serves on numerous boards,” but does not identify his affiliation with Media Matters.Castro was first identified as a Media Matters director in the group’s 2013 Form 990 filed with the IRS and was listed as a director in every subsequent filing through 2019, the latest available Media Matters Form 990.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Over the past few years, the school has embraced an ideology that is damaging to our students’ intellectual and emotional growth and destroying any chance at creating a true community among our diverse population,” wrote Plowe.Plowe, a former Dwight-Englewood parent and upper school English teacher of 7 years, described in detail how her students have come to view all assigned texts through the scope of a power hierarchy, simplifying entire bodies of work into tales of oppressed vs oppressive characters. (RELATED: ‘YouAre Being Shaken Down’: Author Shelby Steele Says Critical Race Theory Is A Plot To ‘ Capture White Guilt’)“I teach students who approach texts in search of the oppressor. I teach students who see inequities in texts that have nothing to do with power. Students have internalized the message that this is the way we read and think about the world, and as a result, they fixate on power and group identity. This fixation has stunted their ability to observe and engage with the full fabric of human experience in our literature,” wrote Plowe in her resignation letter.Plowe further theorized that students have adopted this worldview due to the Dwight-Englewood School’s “fixation” with race. She says that students are afraid to express individual opinions during classroom discussion for fear of being labeled racist. In one instance she describes, a female student refused to complete an essay out of fear of being unconsciously racist, according to her letter.“I have heard from students who don’t participate in discussions for fear of being ostracized. One student did not want to develop her personal essay — about an experience she had in another country — for fear that it might mean that she was, without even realizing it, racist, Plowe wrote.Plowe recounted several instances of the school’s administration denigrating white staff members and attempting to pit faculty members of different races against one another.“On at least two separate occasions in 2017 and 2018, our Head of School, standing at the front of Hajjar Auditorium, told the entire faculty that he would fire us all if he could so that he could replace us all with people of color,”\\xa0wrote Plowe in her letter.“During a recent faculty meeting, teachers were segregated by skin color. Teachers who had light skin were placed into a ‘white caucus group’ and asked to ‘remember’ that we are ‘White’ and ‘to take responsibility for [our] power and privilege’,” Plowe added.Plowe also submitted the Dwight-Englewood School’s faculty training materials and action plan\\xa0to FAIR.

McNeil Jr.The people around him, his inner circle, were quite upset that I would dare publicly contradict the president. That’s when we started getting into things I felt were unfortunate and somewhat nefarious — namely, allowing Peter Navarro to write an editorial in USA Today saying I’m wrong on most of the things I say. Or to have the White House press office send out a detailed list of things I said that turned out to be not true — all of which were nonsense because they were all true.

I have never been muzzled, ever, and I have been doing this since the administration of Ronald Reagan. I am not being muzzled by this administration. We were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, ‘Let’s regroup and figure out how we’re going to be communicating.’ So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared, so I have not been muzzled at all. That was a real misrepresentation of what happened.”And in private emails, he took the same position:Fauci was emphatic in his private correspondence last year that Trump never “muzzled” him — contrary to what the Biden Admin now alleges pic.twitter.com/2Rjoa9X97K— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) June 1, 2021Another pic.twitter.com/UOKu936CoH— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) June 1, 2021Another email reassuring that the Trump Admin was not “muzzling” him pic.twitter.com/ZSHmgVlxdd— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) June 2, 2021WATCH:!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src=\"https://rumble.com/embedJS/ukxsg\"+(arguments[1].video?\\'.\\'+arguments[1].video:\\'\\')+\"/?url=\"+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+\"&args=\"+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, \"script\", \"Rumble\"); Rumble(\"play\", {\"video\":\"vfbp6z\",\"div\":\"rumble_vfbp6z\"});'},\n",

(RELATED: Trump Spent Years Sabotaging Putin’s Nord Stream 2 Dreams. Now Biden Is Helping Them Come True)“If President Biden wants ‘appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible,’ his administration needs to tighten the screws on Vladimir Putin. Like every puppet leader, Lukashenko doesn’t use the bathroom without asking for Moscow’s permission,” Sasse said in a Monday evening statement. “It’s fanciful to imagine he’d hijack a flight between NATO allies without Moscow’s blessing. Putin’s regime is emboldened because the U.S. dropped our sanctions against his treasured Nord Stream 2 pipeline. We should impose those sanctions tonight.”WASHINGTON, DC – OCTOBER 13: U.S. Sen.

Belarus sent a fight jet to intercept the aircraft and divert it to Minsk, the nation’s capitol. Once grounded, authorities searched the aircraft and arrested journalist and activist Raman Pratasevich along with his girlfriend, according to the AP.WATCH: A Belarusian journalist has been detained by police after the commercial passenger aircraft in which he was traveling from Greece to Lithuania was diverted to Minsk due to a purported bomb threat. pic.twitter.com/08t1TQ9aiB— Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (@RFERL) May 23, 2021The European Union has threatened Belarus with sanctions over the incident.'},\n",

The publication reported before the photos were taken down that Whitmer’s chief operating officer Tricia Foster was also present at the event.Michigan’s May 15 order mandates that no more than six people may be seated at the same table. The governor has faced heavy criticism throughout the pandemic for strict COVID restrictions that have forced many Michigan restaurants and businesses to shutter their doors. (RELATED: Whitmer: March Trip To Florida Was To Help Father, ‘Not A Vacation’)“Yesterday, I went with friends to a local restaurant. As more people arrived, the tables were pushed together,” the governor said, according to NBC affiliate WDIV of Detroit. She did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.“Because we were all vaccinated, we didn’t stop to think about it,” she continued. “In retrospect, I should have thought about it. I am human. I made a mistake, and I apologize.” (RELATED: Whitmer Does Not Deny That Her Husband Sought Special Treatment Over Boating On Memorial Day Weekend)The governor was fully vaccinated as of April 29, the Detroit News reported.“Last week Whitmer refused to immediately end her ridiculous restrictions, like a maximum of 6 patrons per table for indoor dining,” Tori Sachs, executive director of Michigan Freedom Fund, told Breitbart. “Now Whitmer has once again completely disregarded her own rules. Whitmer orders rules she and her staff don’t follow themselves while Michiganders and businesses suffer. Whitmer must end her restrictions immediately.”In this screenshot from the DNCC’s livestream of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Michigan Gov.

The convention, which was once expected to draw 50,000 people to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is now taking place virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic. (Handout/DNCC via Getty Images)Whitmer also came under fire in late April and early May when reports surfaced that she had traveled to Florida in March to visit her father. Shortly after her trip, she appeared on “Meet the Press” and urged people to “take this seriously, mask up” and “get tested” — and to specifically avoid traveling for spring break in Florida.The governor defended her trip in May, saying that no tax dollars were used to pay for the weekend trip, emphasizing that it was neither “a vacation” nor “a gift,” and saying that she merely traveled to Florida to care for her father, according to local outlet ABC 12. She also said that she continued her governor’s business throughout the trip.Whitmer also drew fire in January when she traveled to President Joe Biden’s inauguration after she had recently issued a “gatherings and face mask order” requiring Michigan residents to limit their gatherings to 25 or fewer people. (RELATED: These Democratic Leaders Spurned Their Own COVID-19 Rules To Attend The Inauguration)Despite that order, Whitmer attended the inauguration attended by about 2,0000 people, according to an estimate from the Washington Post.“Anyone who watched would have seen that we were spaced out, we were outside, and we were masked up,” Whitmer\\xa0said afterwards. “I have been following the same directives I’ve asked everyone else to.

(RELATED: Pornhub Purges Over 10 Million Videos)The letter is addressed to congressional leaders and signed by 132 survivors of sexual exploitation as well as individuals from 630 non-governmental organizations throughout the world, including Shared Hope International, the Salvation Army, Fight the New Drug, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), religious organizations, academic institutions, and more.“Congress must act to bring justice for survivors whose pleas to remove their child sexual abuse, sex trafficking and non-consensually recorded and distributed material on MindGeek-owned Pornhub have been repeatedly ignored,” Dawn Hawkins, CEO of NCOSE, said in a statement. “MindGeek has profited from illegal material for far too long, and it must be held to account.”Congressional leaders “have the power to discover why the sexual assault of women and children, child sexual abuse material (also known as child pornography), and non-consensual intimate images are being uploaded and distributed on internet platforms,” the letter said.“This is occurring with no apparent legal consequences to individual perpetrators or the digital facilitators of monetized sexual abuse, (which constitutes human trafficking) as well as criminal sexual violence, and gross violations of privacy rights,” the letter said. (RELATED: Sasse Demands Full Investigation After Pornhub Rapidly Changes Policies Over Allegations Of Child Sexual Exploitation)The letter referred to testimony from victims and survivors during an April congressional briefing in which “victims described their powerlessness to remove documentation of crimes committed against them.” One of these victims, a 20-year-old survivor, reportedly begged Pornhub to delete “intimate pictures of her” made when she was 14 years old “to no avail.”“The experience led her to drop out of school, develop drug addiction, and become homeless,” the letter said. “She continues to suffer complex trauma and rarely leaves her home.”MindGeek executives said during the April hearing that the company reviews every video before it is publicly posted, statements which support the accusation that MindGeek “knowingly and willfully distributed child sexual abuse materials which are present on their sites,” the letter said.“Since MindGeek monetized the child sexual abuse materials, these admissions also show that they knowingly facilitated and benefited from sex trafficking of minors,” the letter continued. “Additionally, because MindGeek intentionally placed a download button on every video distributed on Pornhub until December 2020, after being exposed by the New York Times, the company has violated federal age verification and record keeping laws under 18 USC Section 2257 for over a decade.”“It is urgent that Congress demand that law enforcement agencies investigate MindGeek as the pace setter in what amounts to a massive criminal enterprise,” the letter said. “Anything less than full legal accountability is an injustice to victims whose lives have been damaged as a result of MindGeek’s knowing and willful actions.”“Moreover, in actions that may also be consumer fraud, MindGeek has admitted to enabling U.S. citizens to violate federal child pornography possession laws by encouraging the download and possession of images of child sexual abuse (i.e., child pornography),” according to the letter.View Over 700 Survivors, Advocates Call On Congress For Criminal Investigation Into Pornhub on Scribd by Mary Margaret OlohanNew York Times opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof sparked a massive backlash in December when he accused Pornhub of monetizing “child rapes, revenge pornography, spycam videos of women showering, racist and misogynist content and footage of women being asphyxiated in plastic bags.” (RELATED: Hawley, Lawmakers Introduce Bills Allowing Victims To Sue Pornhub, Perpetrators)The popular\\xa0pornography website has been listed as the 10th-most-visited website in the world, according to one ranking, with 3.5 billion visits a month and profits from almost three billion ad impressions every day, Kristof said.Kristof’s story prompted multiple lawmakers to call for investigations into Pornhub, and major credit card companies also began reviewing their relationship with the pornography website. Both\\xa0Visa\\xa0and\\xa0Mastercard told the Daily Caller News Foundation in December that they were no longer allowing their cards to be used on Pornhub, and Mastercard updated its requirements in April to state that banks must ensure that porn websites document the age, identity, and consent of all persons depicted in adult content as well as for those uploading the content.\\xa0Following the announcements from the credit card companies in December, Pornhub began removing videos that were not uploaded by the site’s official partners or members of the site’s programs.

The elite pedigree of Delta Kappa Epsilon—past members include five presidents and a handful of Supreme Court justices—belied its essential frattishness.”“To join, Kavanaugh reportedly endured a series of ritual humiliations, including an order to hop around campus in a leather football helmet while grabbing his crotch and chanting, “I’m a geek, I’m a geek, I’m a power tool. / When I sing this song, I look like a fool,'” Coppins wrote.The Atlantic writer also suggested that Kavanaugh’s love of sports taught him the “virtues of partisanship.”Conservatives want to weaponize his bitterness.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has warned that the organization is “not the new NATO,” however.Blinken and other officials have emphasized the importance of digging into alliances to counter the CCP, as well as calling for a closer look at the persecution of Uighurs.“The more China hears not just our opprobrium, but a chorus of opprobrium from around the world, the better the chance that we’ll get some changes,” Blinken said. “It would be very important if China claims that there is nothing going on that it give access to the international community, to the United Nations.

Which is what I’m doing.”CHICAGO, ILLINOIS – JULY 25: Demonstrators leave a Blue Lives Matter protest on July 25, 2020 in Chicago, Illinois.\\xa0 (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The officer discussed with the DCNF how his wife fears for his safety when he is out on the job in the current chaotic political climate. He described watching the video of former officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd’s neck, noting that he and his fellow officers were horrified at Chauvin’s actions.“I’ve never heard of that before,” he said, referring to Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes. “We were all like what the hell? What is going on here?” (RELATED: Derek Chauvin Found Guilty Of Murder In Death Of George Floyd)Progressive local officials like the Fairfax Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano only make officers’ lives more difficult, the Virginia cop said, noting that Descano “hates police.” Descano did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.“That’s kind of a problem,” the officer said. “We need to be on the same team to fight crime.”Those of us who wield power in this system have a responsibility to learn from & be responsive to this pain. In Fairfax County, I will continue to serve as the independent check on the justice system the community deserves & hold police who abuse their power accountable. 2/2— Steve Descano (@SteveDescano) April 20, 2021 The officer suggested that the best way Americans can champion police officers is to tell their local representatives that they support law enforcement and want the police to be able to to do their job.“I mean, look at the crime rate around the nation, especially around Northern Virginia,” he said. “We don’t want that. We want to live in a safe area.”“We need need help in government,” the officer said. “We need people to be a voice of reason, go to your legislators, contact your local reps, enact laws and do things that will help police not try to hamper us or tie our hands behind our back with every single law they try to pass against us.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Mary McCord, a former Justice Department official who approved efforts to snoop on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, has been appointed to advise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.The same court excoriated government officials in late 2019 for providing misleading information in four applications to surveil Page, who served as a Trump campaign national security adviser.The surveillance court appointed\\xa0McCord, who served as assistant attorney general for national security through May 2017, to be an amicus curiae on April 15.The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relies on eight amicus curiae to provide advice and expertise on matters related to foreign intelligence collection.McCord, who currently works at Georgetown University, helped oversee Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia. She also took part in the process of reviewing an application the FBI submitted for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against Page, a former Naval officer who joined the Trump team in March 2016.McCord is named 25 times in a Justice Department inspector general (IG) report that details a series of missteps by government officials during the Crossfire Hurricane probe.While McCord is not criticized in the IG report, she did review and ultimately approve the flawed FISA applications against Page.The IG report identified 17 “significant” errors and omissions in the FBI’s applications for warrants to surveil Page.Most of the errors were committed by FBI agents and officials and involved with the bureau’s handling of information from former British spy Christopher Steele.The FBI relied heavily on Steele’s information to make the case that Page was working covertly with Russia to help the Trump campaign. Steele alleged in a dossier that the Trump campaign was involved in a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election. (RELATED: Ex-DOJ Official Picked To Oversee FISA Reform Was Ardent Defender Of FBI’s Surveillance Of Carter Page)Steele also claimed that Page played a key role in the Trump-Kremlin connection.Several of Steele’s claims have since been debunked. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and multiple congressional committees have determined that there was no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to meddle in the election.Acting AAG for National Security Mary McCord (L) speaks at the Justice Department in Washington, U.S., March 15, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri GripasThe FISC also reprimanded the FBI for making misleading statements in its applications to spy on Page. The Justice Department invalidated two of the four warrants granted to the bureau.Justice Department officials, including McCord, are largely spared from criticism in the IG report. The FISA failures are largely pinned on FBI agents and officials who failed to tell the Justice Department about evidence that undermined the theory that Page and other Trump aides were working with Russia.FBI investigators failed to disclose contradictions in the Steele dossier, as well as exculpatory statements that Page and another Trump aide, George Papadopoulos, made during conversations with a covert FBI source.McCord told the IG that Justice Department officials thought that surveilling Page would help the FBI investigation. She also appeared to acknowledge that the surveillance might one day be criticized.“She said the collective thinking was that filing the application was a legitimate investigative step even though it may later be criticized unfairly,” reads the IG report, which was released on Dec. 9, 2019.McCord told the IG she spoke with Andrew McCabe, who served as deputy director of the FBI, regarding the dossier and its use in the FISA applications. She said she advised McCabe\\xa0that the FISA application should include more information about who hired Steele.The FISA applications do not disclose the full details of who funded Steele’s work. Steele was ultimately paid by the Clinton campaign and DNC, which hired opposition research firm Fusion GPS through their law firm, Perkins Coie.McCord told the IG that she played a limited role in overseeing the FBI’s probe of the Trump campaign, which was dubbed Crossfire Hurricane. She said she did not attend any of the DOJ national security division’s weekly meetings about the probe held before the 2016 election.She said she did attend meetings after the election regarding the FBI’s investigations of Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, two Trump associates who were initial targets of Crossfire Hurricane. McCord received a comprehensive briefing about Crossfire Hurricane in January 2017, she told the IG.Three officials who signed FISA applications against Page — former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Attorney Generals Sally Yates and Rod Rosenstein — testified last year that they would not have done so if they had known about revelations from the IG report.McCord did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Another amicus curiae for the FISC is David Kris, a former Justice Department official who had defended the FBI’s surveillance of Page prior to the release of the IG report.In 2018, Kris asserted that House Republicans had “falsely accused the FBI of deceiving the FISA Court.” He also said that it “was not true” that the FBI had misled the court about the Steele dossier.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Or they use a phrase like ‘communities of color.’ I don’t know anyone who speaks like that. I don’t know anyone who lives in a ‘community of color.’ I know lots of white and black and brown people and they all live in … neighborhoods.”Carville went on to argue that he didn’t mean the party should stop addressing tough issues like racial injustice — only that they should address such issues using the same kinds of language the voters used rather than jargon. (RELATED: ‘Looking Down At People’: Longtime Democratic Strategist Issues Warning To His Party)“‘Wokeness’ is a problem and everyone knows it. It’s hard to talk to anybody today — and I talk to lots of people in the Democratic Party — who doesn’t say this. But they don’t want to say it out loud,” Carville said. “They’ll get clobbered or canceled.”Carville concluded by saying that he disagreed with those in the party who said that messaging campaigns did not have to be “ruthless.”“It really matters,” he said. “I always tell people that we’ve got to stop speaking Hebrew and start speaking Yiddish. We have to speak the way regular people speak, the way voters speak. It ain’t complicated. That’s how you connect and persuade. And we have to stop allowing ourselves to be defined from the outside.”'},\n",

The data also determines how many Electoral College votes each state will have until 2032, and allocates how federal money is distributed to each state for schools, roads and other public projects.The release was originally\\xa0scheduled\\xa0for December, but faced delays due to the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration’s unsuccessful effort to exclude non-citizens from the count.The official population of the United States is 331,449,281, the bureau said during its presentation, and the southern and western U.S. grew faster than the northeast and Midwest. Utah’s population increased by 18.4% over the past decade, the highest rate of any state in the country, while West Virginia’s population decreased by 3.2%, the highest decrease of any state.Texas is set to gain two congressional seats, the bureau said, bringing its total to 38 and its number of electoral votes to 40. Florida is set to gain one congressional seat, bringing its total to 28 and its number of electoral votes to 30.Oregon, Montana, Colorado and North Carolina will each gain an additional seat, fueled by population growth across the Sun Belt and northwestern U.S.. Montana is the only state in the country to go from one to two congressional districts, giving Democrats a possible competitive seat depending on how the districts are drawn by its bipartisan commission.Most forecasters agree that Republicans, however, have the advantage going into redistricting. The GOP has complete control over the process in Texas, Florida and North Carolina, where a combined 84 seats could be at play.Colorado has an independent commission in charge of its redistricting process, meaning that the event of a partisan gerrymander should be less likely. While while Democrats control redistricting in Oregon, they recently reached an agreement with Republicans in the legislature to give them more say in the process.Florida’s Republican legislature is tasked with drawing new districts, which could give Republicans an advantage in the 2022 midterms. (Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)In the Rust Belt, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania each lost a seat due to slow population growth compared to states in the south and west.California is also set to lose a seat for the first time since it became a state in 1850, and New York is also set to lose a congressional seat, lowering its number of House seats from 29 to 28. If New York had counted 89 more people, then it would have kept its seat and Minnesota would have lost one instead, a census official said during the presentation. (RELATED: Middle Class Americans Are Fleeing California)The data released Monday is just preliminary, and the detailed counts needed to redraw districts will not arrive until the end of September. However, partisan makeup of the House of Representatives is the closest it has been in decades, meaning that any one change could tilt the balance of power.Some forecasters have predicted that redistricting alone could give Republicans enough seats to take back the House majority, possibly stonewalling President Joe Biden’s agenda even if Democrats gain seats in a 2022 Senate map with multiple pick up opportunities.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Planned Parenthood president did not mention Sanger’s “Negro Project,” an initiative aimed at giving black women access to birth control.“By privileging whiteness, we’ve contributed to America harming Black women and other women of color,” McGill Johnson wrote.Dillon said that for years, fact checkers have white washed Sanger’s legacy and downplayed her comments on eugenics and her targeting of the black community with birth control. (RELATED: Black Pro-Life Leaders Condemn Planned Parenthood’s ‘Hollow’ Denunciation Of Margaret Sanger)“Planned Parenthood has finally acknowledged their racist roots, so what do the fact checkers who ran defense for them (and their founder Margaret Sanger) have to say for themselves?” Dillon tweeted Tuesday.Planned Parenthood has finally acknowledged their racist roots, so what do the fact checkers who ran defense for them (and their founder Margaret Sanger) have to say for themselves? pic.twitter.com/lr0gI3SPGL— Seth Dillon (@SethDillon) April 20, 2021 “Fact checkers had every opportunity to hold Planned Parenthood accountable. But here’s @NPR “debunking” what Planned Parenthood now admits is true,” Dillon tweeted, linking to an NPR fact check on former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson’s assertion that Planned Parenthood was started to control the black population.“Did Margaret Sanger believe in eugenics?” the fact check asked. “Yes, but not in the way Carson implied.”The NPR fact check also said that Sanger’s attitude towards “African-Americans can certainly be viewed as paternalistic,” but added that “there is no evidence she subscribed to the more racist ideas of the time or that she coerced black women into using birth control.”Dillon also drew attention to a Snopes fact check on whether a photograph showed Sanger at a KKK rally. Snopes rated the claim as “miscaptioned,” noting that while Sanger once spoke to the KKK, the photo “purportedly showing Sanger at a Klan rally is not genuine,” adding that “Sanger expressed no affinity for the KKK.”“Here’s @snopes trying to create distance between Sanger and the KKK, even as they admit she spoke at a klan rally,” Dillon continued. “They claim she ‘disparaged’ the klan’s mission and only spoke to them to reach a wider audience.” (RELATED: Critics Portray Pro-Life Advocates As Racists. The Founder Of Planned Parenthood Had A History Pro-Eugenics Comments And Targeting Black Communities)FactCheck.org defended both Sanger and Planned Parenthood from Herman Cain’s claim that Sanger wanted to prevent “black babies from being born,” Dillon noted. Cain, who died in July, was CEO of Godfather’s Pizza and ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.“They smeared Herman Cain (who’s black), while advancing PP’s lie that Sanger ‘worked for social and racial justice,'” the Babylon Bee CEO said.The Washington Post called Sanger a “racial pioneer” when Glenn Kessler fact checked Cain’s comments in 2011. WaPo gave Cain’s comments four Pinocchio’s, said Cain was “spouting historical fiction,” and wrote “there is no evidence that Sanger ever sought to kill black babies, either through the Negro Project or any other endeavor.”“They perfectly echoed Planned Parenthood’s prior sugarcoating of Sanger’s views, as if they’d outsourced this piece to Planned Parenthood’s PR team,” Dillon joked.\\xa0The CEO of the Babylon Bee, a conservative satire website, also highlighted a Politifact check that made “sure you know just how much Margaret Sanger loved black people, and how wrong Ben Carson is for thinking otherwise.”“They cite a biographer who claimed ‘Sanger actually opposed prejudice,'” Dillon said.\\xa0McGill Johnson’s New York Times op-ed noted that even though Sanger eventually distanced herself from the eugenics movement, she endorsed a Supreme Court decision that allowed states to sterilize the “unfit” without their consent — “a ruling that led to the sterilization of tens of thousands of people in the 20th century,” McGill Johnson wrote.“The first human trials of the birth control pill — a project that was Sanger’s passion later in her life — were conducted with her backing in Puerto Rico, where as many as 1,500 women were not told that the drug was experimental or that they might experience dangerous side effects,” the Planned Parenthood president said.McGill Johnson wrote that “up until now, Planned Parenthood has failed to own the impact of our founder’s actions,” but noted that whether Sanger was a racist is “not a simple yes or no question.”“We don’t know what was in Sanger’s heart, and we don’t need to in order to condemn her harmful choices,” the Planned Parenthood president said. “What we have is a history of focusing on white womanhood relentlessly.”“Whether our founder was a racist is not a simple yes or no question,” McGill Johnson said. “Our reckoning is understanding her full legacy, and its impact. Our reckoning is the work that comes next.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Bolton also argued to reporters that an endorsement from Trump is not as beneficial to Republicans as “the commentariat” says.The poll was conducted via telephone, surveying 1,000 General Election Voters and an oversample of 600 Republican voters. The margin of error for General Election Voters was +/- 3.1%. For Republicans, the rate was +/- 4.0%.“I think there’s a myth and reality at work here,” Bolton said on a call revealing the polling data, according to Politico. “The myth is, if Trump is for you, you’re in great shape. And If he’s against you you’re toast. We tested the question of how it affects primary voters if Trump opposes a candidate and it shows something of a reality very different from the myth. I don’t purport to say that’s a clear answer but it’s a pretty wide diversion from the conventional wisdom in the commentariat.”WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 22: US President Donald Trump speaks as National security advisor John Bolton listens during a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in the Oval Office of the White House on May 22, 2018 in Washington DC. (Photo by Oliver Contreras-Pool/Getty Images)Bolton went on to argue that Trump lost vast numbers of supporters following the pro-Trump storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, and he will only lose more now that he cannot engage with voters on Twitter, Facebook or from the bully pulpit of the White House. (RELATED: Chris Wallace Dismisses John Bolton’s Book As ‘A One Week Story’)“There didn’t appear to be the recognition that things changed on January 20, that Trump had gone from sitting in the most powerful office in the world to sitting by the swimming pool at Mar-a-Lago and that that’s going to have an effect over time as it is for any president who leaves office,” Bolton said.Trump’s office responded to Bolton’s poll in a statement to the Daily Caller, with Trump Pollster John McLaughlin saying Trump is the “strongest endorsement I have ever witnessed in politics.”“Nationally, polling continually shows that 69% of all Republican primary voters want President Trump to run again in 2024—including 76% of Trump voters and 70% of Republicans. If President Trump runs again, Republican primary voters will support him 82% to 15%—including 89% among Trump voters and 83% among Republicans,” McLaughlin added.“Polls can be manipulated to deliver a result the sponsor desires. Records can’t. In the past two years, Trump’s endorsement record in Congressional special and primary elections is 121-2,” former White House Political Director Brian Jack told the Caller. “President Trump’s endorsement record – which you won’t find in [Bolton’s] poll’s release – speaks for itself.”Bolton and Trump have been at one another’s throats since Bolton left the Trump administration over its handling of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Bolton went so far as to predict that Trump won’t run for president in 2024 based on the poll, but will only talk loudly about it in the interim years.Trump has heavily implied that he will run for re-election in 2024 but has not officially announced his candidacy. He has also gone to great lengths to maintain his influence in the Republican Party, telling Fox News Host Sean Hannity on Monday night that he is “all in” and is willing to hold rallies for candidates who need it.'},\n",

Maybe they shouldn’t have done it, but the atmosphere was such that they did it. They are not crooks,” Waters said in a ratio interview with KABC, the Los Angeles Times reported on May 10, 1992.Waters also defended a woman she met who stole pairs of shoes for her children during the riots.“One lady said her children didn’t have any shoes. She just saw those shoes there, a chance for all of her children to have new shoes. Goddamn it!

(RELATED: Biden Administration Lifts Restrictions On Abortion Pills Despite Risks, Allows Them To Be Delivered By Mail)CLI accused the FDA of an “abundance of neglect,” warning that the FDA’s decision allows a lack of physician oversight which could contribute to a lack of reporting of non-fatal but adverse events, a lack of knowledge about the possibility of abortion pill reversal for women who change their mind after taking the first abortion pill, and more.The abortion drugs involve a two step process: first taking the abortion drug mifepristone, then taking the drug misoprostol.BREAKING: ACOG win! The @US_FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock has notified @ACOG and @MySMFM that the agency will “exercise enforcement discretion” regarding #mifepristone through the duration of the #COVID19 public health emergency. 1/ pic.twitter.com/PDpJ7000bc— ACOG Action (@ACOGAction) April 13, 2021 “First, you take a pill called\\xa0mifepristone,”\\xa0according to Planned Parenthood’s website. “This medicine stops the pregnancy from growing. Some people feel nauseous or start bleeding after taking mifepristone, but it’s not common. Your doctor or nurse may also give you antibiotics to take to prevent infection.”“The second medicine is called\\xa0misoprostol,” the organization said. “You’ll either take the misoprostol right away, or up to 48 hours after you take the first pill — your doctor or nurse will let you know how and when to take it. This medicine causes cramping and bleeding to empty your uterus.”Live Action Founder and President Lila Rose cited FDA data showing at least 24 deaths and 4,000 reports of adverse events after taking the abortion drugs. The adverse effects were “from women experiencing hospitalization, hemorrhage, excruciating abdominal pain, and severe life threatening infections after taking the abortion pill regimen,” according to Rose.“The reality is that the ‘success’ of Mifeprex is a dead child,” Rose said in a statement. “Real medicine does not result in a dead person.”WHITE OAK, MD – JULY 20: A sign for the Food And Drug Administration is seen outside of the headquarters on July 20, 2020 in White Oak, Maryland. (Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)The FDA had\\xa0approved the use of the abortion drug mifepristone in 2000, also called Mifeprex,\\xa0for up to 10 weeks’ gestation. But the FDA explicitly\\xa0warned that buyers should not purchase Mifeprex over the internet “because they will bypass important safeguards designed to protect their health.” (RELATED: Abortion Advocates Call On FDA To Remove Restrictions On Abortion Drugs Over Coronavirus Crisis, Push Abortion Telemedicine)The FDA updated its website Tuesday to note that it conducted a “careful scientific review” of both in-person and by-mail dispensing of the drugs, “either by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber, or through a mail-order pharmacy when such dispensing is done under the supervision of a certified prescriber.”“The FDA’s intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to these requirements during the public health emergency is the result of a thorough scientific review by experts within FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), who evaluated relevant information, including available clinical outcomes data and adverse event reports,” the FDA’s website said.Planned Parenthood\\xa0cites a number of possible but “really rare” risks\\xa0that abortion drugs pose to women, including “blood clots in your uterus,” “bleeding too much or too long,” “infection,” “allergic reaction to one of the medicines,” “some of the pregnancy tissue is left in your uterus,” or “the abortion pills don’t work and the pregnancy doesn’t end.”President Joe Biden’s administration also put a cautionary pause Tuesday on the use of Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine after six women reportedly developed “rare and severe” blood clots. The pause is recommended by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA.Pro-abortion advocates celebrated the FDA decision as a major win for abortion rights, but Rose warned that allowing the abortion drugs to be dispensed by mail will enable predators and put women at risk.This critical victory comes after a year of litigation, and thousands of us making our voices heard.— ACLU (@ACLU) April 13, 2021 “Because of today’s decision, women will be home alone delivering a dead child, unsure whether the volume of blood loss they see is ‘normal’ for the abortion procedure or them hemorrhaging and bleeding out,” Rose said in a statement. “Unsure if the pain they feel is the ‘normal’ pain of the abortion procedure or pain from their ectopic pregnancy going undiagnosed and now threatening their life.”SBA List also noted that the FDA’s literature did not include a variety of studies and articles that have found that the abortion pill elevates health risks. The organization highlighted a study published in a 2021 volume of Issues in Law & Medicine, co-authored by Dr. Donna Harrison, a CLI Scholar and the CEO of the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists.“Our review of all the Adverse Events from mifepristone as an abortion drug revealed serious concerns about hemorrhage, infections, and fetal tissue left inside,” Harrison said in a statement. “There were over 500 life-threatening complications, which would have been deaths if the women had not had timely access to the Emergency Room.”“These women without access to an ER are exactly the women being targeted with abortions by mail, and those who are most at risk of death by patient abandonment,” Harrison said. “We know from other studies that reports from the FDA only represent a small fraction of the actual adverse events happening to women across the country.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Blinken argues all rights are “co-equal” and that religious freedom should not be prioritized over any others. Conservative critics respond that virtually every genocide of the past century has been against a religious minority.“This is a major shift away from international religious freedom – moving away from even calling it religious freedom,” Nina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, told Real Clear Politics. “It’s more of a watered down freedom of belief or religion, and equating religion with belief, which is very dangerous because that would mean you have a right to believe what you want to believe but you may not be allowed to practice it in a public square.”The US delegation led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken (C), flanked by US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan (R), face their Chinese counterparts at the opening session of US-China talks at the Captain Cook Hotel in Anchorage, Alaska on March 18, 2021. – China’s actions “threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday at the opening of a two-day meeting with Chinese counterparts in Alaska. (FREDERIC J. BROWN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)Blinken’s greatest human rights challenge today is China’s ongoing genocide against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, also fundamentally a religious freedom issue. Nevertheless, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has sought to cut off funding for faith-based relief groups in the Middle East, despite a bipartisan Trump-era law requiring aid be provided to these communities. (RELATED: ‘Get What They Deserve’: Trump Mocks SCOTUS, Predicts Court-Packing From Biden)The Biden administration’s changes aren’t just on policy, however. They also appear to have renamed relevant offices to remove references to religious freedom or religion in general. A recent tweet from USAID touted the appointment of Rita Stephan as the regional coordinator and liaison for the office of “Equity for Diverse Communities in the Middle East and North Africa.” Under President Trump and previous presidents the office had been known as the “Religious and Ethnic Communities Office.”A spokeswoman for USAID told Real Clear Politics the tweet had mistakenly changed the name, but no explanation has been offered and the tweet remains on the USAID Middle East account.It’s #WomensHistoryMonth, and we can’t talk about female leaders without introducing our own Rita Stephan, Regional Coordinator & Liaison for Equity for Diverse Communities in MENA.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Federal prosecutor John Durham recently subpoenaed a prominent foreign policy think tank as part of his investigation into the Steele dossier, the New York Times reported Monday.According to The New York Times, Durham subpoenaed the Brookings Institution for records related to Igor Danchenko, a former analyst at the think tank who was the primary source for dossier author Christopher Steele.The development sheds some light on a question recently asked by Donald Trump.“Where’s Durham? Is he a living, breathing human being? Will there ever be a Durham report?” Trump asked in a statement released on March 26.Durham, who is serving as a special counsel, is conducting a broad but vague investigation into several aspects of the intelligence gathering activities against the Trump campaign.Much of the investigation has followed up in revelations from a Justice Department inspector general’s report which said that the FBI made 17 “significant” errors and omissions in applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against Carter Page.Many of the errors centered on the FBI’s handling of the dossier, which Christopher Steele compiled on behalf of the Clinton campaign and DNC.The FBI failed to disclose to the FISA court that investigators had failed to verify Steele’s allegations. The bureau also did not tell the court that Danchenko made statements to FBI agents in January 2017 that conflicted with the dossier. (RELATED: Devin Nunes Wants To Investigate Liberal Think Tank’s Role In Spreading Steele Dossier)According to an FBI document declassified last year, the bureau opened a counterintelligence investigation of Danchenko in 2009 based on a tip that he asked colleagues about security clearances. The bureau considered applying for a FISA warrant against Danchenko in 2010 but dropped the idea after he left the U.S.Christopher Steele (L) arrives at the High Court in London on July 24, 2020, to attend his defamation trial brought by Russian tech entrepreneur Alexej Gubarev.\\xa0(Photo by TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images)Danchenko worked for several consulting firms after leaving Brookings in 2010. He also at some point began working for Steele’s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence.Investigations led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Justice Department inspector general and several congressional committees all undermined the dossier’s central thesis of a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” between the Trump campaign and Russian government.The IG report also debunked several specific claims of collusion that are found in the Steele dossier. One of those is Steele’s claim that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen visited Prague in August 2016 to meet with Kremlin insiders regarding hackers.The general counsel for Brookings told The Times that Durham’s office issued its subpoena on Dec. 31, and that the think tank had turned over documents in February.“Consistent with its practices in such matters, Brookings provided the responsive documents, none of which contained information associated with the reports known as the Steele dossier,” Michael Cavadel told The Times.Other Brookings officials were aware of the Steele dossier before it was published in early January 2017.Steele, a former MI6 officer, has testified in the United Kingdom that he provided a copy of the documents before the 2016 election to Strobe Talbott, a former State Department official who was president of Brookings at the time.Fiona Hill, a who served as a director of Brookings’ Russia program before joining the Trump administration, told Congress in 2019 that Talbott showed her a copy of the dossier a day before it was published by the media.Hill told Congress in 2019 that she thought the dossier was packed with Russian disinformation the first time she saw it.Danchenko and Hill worked together at Brookings. Steele told the FBI in 2017 that Hill introduced him to Danchenko in 2011, according to declassified FBI documents.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Most of the other presidential candidates embraced unrestricted abortion access or would not say when they would draw the line on abortion.WATCH:\\xa0Yang on late-term abortions #OurRightsOurCourts: “We have to get back to the point where nobody should be celebrating abortion… it’s a tragedy, to me, if someone decides they don’t want to have a child… celebrating children, family, these are universal human values” pic.twitter.com/HdgFsTZzO8— Andrew Solender (@AndrewSolender) February 8, 2020 The video that circulated Friday did not include the questions leading up to Yang’s comments, Politico noted, which took place in a 26-minute-long interview. (RELATED: ANALYSIS: Infanticide Is A Real Issue, Despite Establishment Media Narrative)“Even people who are pro abortion rights — some aren’t that comfortable with this idea,” MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle said to Yang. “How are you sensitive to those people? How do you win their support while also taking the position that you do personally?”“It’s a tragedy to me if someone decides that they don’t want to have a child and they’re on the fence,” Yang responded. “I mean it’s a very difficult personal decision and it should be something we’re very very sensitive to.”“I think that celebrating children, family — like these are universal human values,” he said. “And if we manage to lead on that and then say, ‘But we also stand for women’s reproductive rights,’ I believe we can bring Americans closer together on a really, really important personal issue.”A video of Yang’s comments began re-circulating on Twitter Friday night. (RELATED: Pro-Life Democrat: Buttigieg Gave Voters ‘A Reason To Vote Against Him’)“WTF is this garbage??? Seriously. This is beyond the pale,” tweeted former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. “I have sole authority in all that pertains to my body INCLUDING choosing NOT to have children. Ain’t nothing tragic about it dude. Ever. #MyBodyMyChoice.“Planned Parenthood’s senior vice president objected to Yang’s use of the word “tragedy.”“A tragedy to decide not to have children??? In 2021? In a global pandemic? In a global climate crisis? In a systemic racism crisis? People should be forced to have kids? No sir,” Melanie Roussell Newman tweeted.Yang’s fellow mayoral candidate Maya Wiley tweeted that “Political leaders should fight to expand access for those who need it, not make them feel convicted in the court of public opinion for taking control of their health & body.”Repro choices, incl. abortion, is health care.

The lawsuit was filed by the Religious Exemption Accountability Project in the U.S. District Court of Oregon on March 29.Cortman stressed how “radical and broad this request is.” (RELATED: Here’s What’s In The Equality Act)“It attacks every single religious school in the entire country,” he told the DCNF. “It seeks to undo protections for religious colleges and universities to be able to teach and operate according to their own religious beliefs. So it basically says that both the school and the student gets penalized if you continue to abide by and teach your religious faith, or you have to renounce those beliefs to participate in the program that everybody else gets to participate in.”“So the ironic thing in this lawsuit, it actually creates constitutional violations,” he continued. “It doesn’t solve them. It creates constitutional violations by discriminating against the schools for operating according to their faith.”The motion to intervene notes that though Title IX “generally forbids differential treatment based on sex,” this prohibition does not apply to religious education institutions if it conflicts with their religious tenets.“Religious Schools are educational institutions controlled by religious organizations. They are exempt from Title IX and its accompanying regulations to the extent those laws are interpreted to curtail Religious Schools’ freedom to act in accordance with their religious convictions,” the motion said. (RELATED: Psaki Won’t Say If Biden Will Keep Religious Freedom Office At HHS)“And Religious Schools’ sincere religious beliefs conflict with application of Title IX to the extent that Title IX’s definition of ‘sex’ is interpreted to include ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender identity,'” the motion continued. “As such, Religious Schools directly benefit from the Religious Exemption, and disposing of this action could significantly impair their statutory and constitutional rights.”ADF Motion to Intervene and… by Mary Margaret OlohanSenior Counsel Cortman told the DCNF that the lawsuit is not only punishing religious schools, but that it’s also punishing students who choose to go to a religious school that follows their own religious beliefs.“The student is penalized by not being able to receive any financial aid at all, whether that’s grants or loans or any type of financial aid,” Cortman said. “This does tremendous harm to any student that decides to attend a religious school that abides by their beliefs.” (RELATED: Biden Education Secretary Pick Says Schools Have Responsibility To Let Biological Males In Girls Sports If They Are Trans)The lawsuit will have a “large impact” on religious freedom, he said, highlighting recent “attacks on religious freedom” through President Joe Biden’s executive orders and through Democratic support for the Equality Act.The rights of religious schools are at stake, Cortman said, and ADF is “asking for the court to allow them to participate, to defend the right to be able to operate according to their faith.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But in 2020, many feared the economic repercussions from closed schools and businesses more than getting sick from the coronavirus.

Latino precincts in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New Jersey and Nevada all shifted towards the former president by between 6 to 20 points from 2016 to 2020, the report found.\\xa0(RELATED: Trump Wins Florida, Improves On 2016 Margin)The most Clinton-Trump Latino voters were Cubans in Florida, where 15% who voted for Clinton in 2016 did so for Trump in 2020, according to an Equis/Cuba Study Group survey cited in the report. In other states, Trump’s inroads came mostly from Latino voters who did not participate at all in 2016.In Nevada, they were “less ideological, younger, more foreign-born than regular Trump voters,” the report said.For Democrats to attempt to reverse Republican gains among Latino voters, the report’s researchers said, they must commit to continued engagement and investment within their communities instead of solely campaigning in them months before an election. They added that Trump’s campaign took advantage of Democrats’ complacency and launched ads targeting low-information Latino voters on platforms they more often used.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

John Katko and Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, titled the Border Surge Response and Resilience Act, mandates that DHS outline specific metrics that would trigger their response plan. It reflects growing bipartisan concerns that the surge of migrants may lead to a humanitarian crisis.Once the plan is activated, DHS could pull $1 billion from the Migration Surge Border Response Fund as needed, meaning that the agency would not have to reallocate its own budget to pay for food, transportation or first-aid for the increasing number of migrants.

(Dario Lopez-Mills – Pool/Getty Images)“After hearing firsthand from border patrol agents, it’s clear they need interagency backup and accountability across the Federal Government to appropriately handle border surges,” Katko said in a joint statement. “Agents and officers on the frontlines are suffering through another crisis, in the midst of a global pandemic, and some still haven’t been vaccinated.”“We need greater confidence that the Federal Government can manage these crises going forward. This bill would do just that,” Katko said.“It is critical that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is proactive and develops a strategy to adequately manage large migration flows at our southern border,” Cuellar said in a joint statement. “This bipartisan legislation will allow the federal government to employ a whole-of-government approach to create a response framework that anticipates migration surges, allowing them to quickly shift resources and take immediate action to mitigate a humanitarian crisis.”While migrant surges have occurred in the past, DHS projections, first reported by Axios, show that the current increase could last for over seven months, with as many as 26,000 unaccompanied children reaching the border by September 2021 alone. The increase means the government would need an extra 34,000 beds by September to meet the surge in unaccompanied minors.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in March that crossings were on pace to hit a 20-year high, even as the U.S. expelled the majority of single adults and families.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He also claimed that an attorney who formerly worked for the Justice Department has attempted to extort him for $25 million by publicizing details of the investigation.McCarthy was asked about the allegations against Gaetz during an interview on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”Host Dana Perino noted that McCarthy has called for California Rep.

Let’s get all the information,” McCarthy said.McCarthy said that he has not heard from the Justice Department about Gaetz and has not spoken to the Florida Republican.He then went on at length about Swalwell.“The problem with Eric Swalwell is in the private sector he couldn’t pass a security clearance. He couldn’t get one. Why would he get one in Congress?” said McCarthy.The New York Times reported that the Justice Department’s investigation of Gaetz is related to a federal case against Joel Greenberg, a former Florida state official. Greenberg was indicted last year on a slew of federal charges, including sex trafficking of a minor.Gaetz and Greenberg posed for photos together at the White House in 2019.According to the Times, the government is investigating whether Gaetz violated laws that prohibit people from inducing minors across state lines for sex.Gaetz on Tuesday denied having a relationship with anyone underage, and said in a statement that he and his father have been cooperating with federal investigators to uncover an extortion plot against him.“Over the past several weeks my family and I have been victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million while threatening to smear my name,” Gaetz said in the statement.He said that his father, a former Florida state lawmaker, has worn a wire at the FBI’s direction in order to uncover the scheme.“No part of the allegations against me are true, and the people pushing these lies are targets of the ongoing extortion investigation,” said Gaetz.He also called on the Justice Department to release tapes that he said would exonerate him.In an interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Gaetz said that Donald McGee, a former Justice Department official who practices law in Florida, was behind the extortion plot against him.McGee told The Daily Beast that Gaetz’s allegations were “completely, totally false.”Neither McGee nor Gaetz’s office have responded to requests for additional comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Florida is considering a sweeping elections bill that would tighten multiple voting laws and widen what is considered to be illegal solicitation in the state.H.B. 7041, which is advancing through Florida’s Republican state legislature along party lines, would amend the vote-by-mail process and limit who is allowed to drop off a ballot on a voter’s behalf. The legislation would also make it a crime to give voters food or water within 150 feet of polling places.The bill would implement voter ID requirements for mail-in voting and limit who can drop off a ballot at a drop box to an immediate family member or somebody living at the same residence as the elector.Under current law, the proposed bill outlined, voters cannot be offered any assistance within 100 feet of polling places. The bill would expand that zone, and prohibits personnel from giving “any item” or “interacting or attempting to interact” with voters in the widened 150 foot area.The controversial addition mirrors a similar bill signed into law in Georgia on Thursday. That bill modified the state’s early voting period, overhauled its election laws and made it a misdemeanor crime to offer food or water to voters waiting in line.The Florida and Georgia bills are two examples of multiple overhaul bills that have appeared in state legislatures across the country. Republicans have argued that the changes are necessary to improve voter confidence, but they follow months of former President Donald Trump falsely claiming the election was “stolen” and “rigged” even as members of his own administration reaffirmed that it was not.\\xa0(RELATED: Trump Applauds Georgia Voting Restrictions)Workers at the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Office process voters’ ballots inside of the Elections Service Center Operations Department on November 3, 2020 in Largo, Florida. (Octavio Jones/Getty Images)But unlike Georgia, Trump won Florida after improving on his 2016 margin. Despite his victory, Republicans across the state have urged the legislature to pass overhaul bills aimed at restricting mail-in voting and drop box access in order to improve voter confidence.“The result of 2020 … was that Florida had the most transparent and efficient election anywhere in the country,” said Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in a February speech calling for new restrictions on mail-in voting. “But we also can’t rest on our laurels. We need to continue to stay ahead of the curve, we need to make sure that our citizens have confidence in our elections.” (RELATED: ‘This Is Jim Crow In The 21st Century’: Biden Releases Statement On Georgia Election Bill)The multiple state bills are a sharp contrast to H.R. 1, the expansive voting reform legislation passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. The bill is aimed at countering what its advocates say are attacks on voting rights nationwide, and it would almost completely federalize the election process, outlaw partisan gerrymandering, legalize ballot harvesting and expand mail-in voting.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Andrew Cuomo’s administration reportedly allowed members of his family as well as other influential people to have special access to government-run COVID-19 testing, mostly in March 2020, the New York Times reported Thursday.At the time, testing was not widely available to the public and it was unclear how serious the pandemic was, according to the publication, but CNN anchor Chris Cuomo and his family were tested several times.Greenwald heavily criticized CNN spokesman Matt Dornic’s statement saying “it is not surprising that in the earliest days of the once-in-a-century global pandemic, when Chris was showing symptoms and was concerned about the possible spread, he turned to anyone he could for advice and assistance, as any human being would.”Greenwald called this response “grotesque,” accusing CNN of “defending and even glorifying what their host did in corruptly obtaining for himself medical care unavailable to the broader public.”\\xa0(RELATED: ‘I’m A Human Being,’ Says Top Cuomo Aide Implicated In Nursing Home Scandal)“For more than a year now, CNN’s promotion of ‘interviews’ conducted by Chris Cuomo of his own brother — in which the CNN host repeatedly heaped lavish praise on Gov. Cuomo and even hyped him as a presidential contender while the Governor was corruptly and possibly criminally covering up COVID deaths — was one of the most glaring breaches of journalistic ethics imaginable,” Greenwald wrote.“It was not cute or charming,” the journalist continued. “It was corrupt. And it aggressively deceived CNN’s audience.”Greenwald suggested that CNN knew its actions were corrupt since Chris Cuomo recently announced he would not cover news of his brothers scandals: the\\xa0embattled governor is now being investigated by both the state attorney general’s office for allegations of workplace sexual misconduct and by the Department of Justice for his role in knowingly undercounting the deaths of New York nursing home patients.“What conceivable framework makes it journalistically permissible for a news host to shower his own brother with praise, but then not cover his scandals,” Greenwald asked.“But now Chris Cuomo is directly involved in a serious abuse of power scandal by his brother: in fact, he’s the prime beneficiary of that scandal,” he continued. “He sought special medical favors from his brother, depriving other sick people more in need of it than he, by exploiting the fact that his brother is Governor and thus rules the state. That’s a scandal by any measure — one involving not only the Governor but also the CNN host.”The journalist pointed out that on May 6, a few weeks after the governor reportedly began giving his brother special treatment, Chris Cuomo began an interview with Andrew Cuomo by discussing how New York did not have the resources to give the public COVID testing.WATCH:\\xa0 “So not only did they conceal that they had both just used state resources to get Chris that scarce testing, but they both acknowledged that there was a resource shortage to serve the general public, even as Gov. Cuomo was lavishing those resources on his own family,” Greenwald wrote.“Even worse, Cuomo spoke openly on CNN about his COVID diagnosis and what he was doing for it,” he continued. “But he concealed from the public the fact that the Governor of New York arranged for him to have special treatment and state-funded access to tests that were unavailable to most of the public.”Greenwald called CNN’s defense of Cuomo “insultingly dishonest.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: New York Admits Knowingly Undercounting Nursing Home Deaths After Quietly Changing Reporting Rules)“The same exact defense CNN offered here could be made if Chris Cuomo had instead bribed state officials to provide him special medical treatment unavailable to the general public, or if he had broken into the home of another sick person to steal their medication that he could not obtain for himself,” he wrote.“It would be understandable that a person with COVID would want to do this, in the sense that it is a rational motive,” he continued. “But the fact that Cuomo had a rational motive for doing this does not make it less corrupt, unethical or amoral. There are all sorts of things that it may be ‘understandable’ for us to want for ourselves that the law, morality and/or ethics nonetheless prevents us from obtaining.”CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Chuck Grassley is demanding an update from the Biden administration on the status of criminal referrals the Republican submitted for what he calls “bogus” rape allegations made against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Grassley submitted four criminal referrals from Sept. 29, 2018 to Nov. 2, 2018, regarding unsubstantiated allegations against Kavanaugh. Two of the referrals were against disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti and his client, Julie Swetnick, who claimed she witnessed Kavanaugh taking part in a gang rape at a party in the 1980s.Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a letter Wednesday to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray that neither of the agencies have responded to his requests for updates on the criminal referrals.Grassley requested an update on the referrals from the Trump administration on Oct. 8, 2019, which also went unanswered.“These failures are entirely unacceptable,” the senator wrote in his letter on Wednesday.“Those referrals highlighted serious cases in which individuals made materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements to Committee investigators,” Grassley wrote to Garland and Wray.The referrals\\xa0for Avenatti and Swetnick centered on their claims that Swetnick witnessed Kavanaugh taking part in a gang rape at a party in the 1980s.Sen.

She also gave conflicting statements in interviews about Kavanaugh.Avenatti has since been convicted on bribery and extortion charges.“The Committee found that Mr. Avenatti, who has since been convicted on felony extortion charges, and his client, Ms. Swetnick, had a long history of credibility issues and may have criminally conspired to mislead the Committee regarding those allegations and obstruct its investigation,” Grassley wrote. (RELATED: Avenatti Convicted On All Counts In Nike Extortion Trial)Republicans also submitted referrals against a person from Rhode Island who admitted on social media to lying about an allegation that Kavanaugh had assaulted someone on a boat.They also made a referral against a woman named Judy Munro-Leighton, who said she was the author of a letter that stated that Kavanaugh and a friend raped her “several times each.”Munro-Leighton later retracted her claim to have written the letter.Grassley said that the allegedly false allegations “materially impeded the Committee’s work and diverted important Committee resources during its time-sensitive investigation.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': \"In interviews with the Daily Caller News Foundation, two women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault condemned news that Clinton will co-host a women’s empowerment event with Vice President Kamala Harris.Clinton has been accused of sexually harassing Paula Jones, of raping Juanita Broaddrick, of sexually assaulting Kathleen Willey, and of repeatedly sexually assaulting Leslie Millwee. The former president, who has denied all of these allegations, also faced suspicions about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 from apparent suicide.Broaddrick and Millwee discussed the upcoming Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) event in phone interviews with the Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday. The women criticized Democrats and the #METOO movement for ignoring their sexual assault allegations and questioned why the Biden administration is giving Clinton a platform at all.“Oh my God, here we go again. When are people going to understand what this man is?” Broaddrick said to the DCNF.“I think they understand,” she said, “it’s just against their political affiliation.”The Clinton rape accuser said that each time Democrats give Clinton a public platform “it’s like somebody just slapping you in the face and saying, ‘you don’t matter.'” She also accused the #METOO movement of failing to acknowledge allegations against Clinton other than his consensual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.“They’ve never acknowledged that we exist,” Broaddrick said. (RELATED: ‘You Better Get Some Ice For That’: Here’s What To Know About Bill Clinton And #METOO Allegations)Millwee cannot think of anyone more “ill suited” to discuss women’s empowerment than Clinton with his alleged years-long “history of abusing, raping and sexually assaulting women,” she told the DCNF.“And he is going to get up on a stage and tell us about how to be empowered?” Millwee said. “I truly can’t think of anything more brazen. I think this goes to show you the political power that the Clintons still have.”“It’s just such an upset upside down world when you have a rapist and a sexual assaulter who is giving tips and information to try and help empower women,” Millwee added. “I can’t think of anything more ludicrous than that.”The Clinton accuser noted that Harris formerly said that she believed women who accused President Joe Biden of sexual misconduct. (RELATED: ‘I Want The Same Equal Treatment’: Biden Accuser Tara Reade Tears Into Media, Women’s Groups, Democratic Politicians)“It goes back a lot to partisan politics and I hate to keep bringing that up, but I think that’s crux of it,” Millwee said. “It’s brazen. This man has gotten by with so much in the last 50 or 60 years. And I think it goes back to a power entitlement. He feels like he can do whatever he wants. Nothing’s going to get in this way, and he’s going to bulldoze his way through anything he wants to.”US President Bill Clinton listens to a speaker 27 July during a meeting on the Social Security hosted by the Concord Coalition at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Clinton has been subpoenaed by independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr to testify before a federal grand jury investigating allegations of sex and perjury. (LUKE FRAZZA/AFP via Getty Images)Neither Harris nor Clinton responded to requests for comment from the DCNF for this story.Broaddrick told the Washington Post in February 1999 that she met Clinton in April 1978 when he was 31 and the Arkansas attorney general running for governor. She was working as a 35-year-old volunteer for his campaign. She said the two chatted and he invited her to his campaign office, an invitation which she accepted. Clinton later changed the location to her hotel coffee shop, then told her too many reporters were in the lobby and asked if they could have coffee in her room.Broaddrick alleges that Clinton began kissing her, though she resisted, after which he allegedly pulled her onto the bed and raped her. Broaddrick told the Post that she did not scream as the alleged incident happened very quickly, and that Clinton grabbed onto her lip with his mouth, leaving it bruised and swollen.“The last thing he said to me was, ‘You better get some ice for that.’ And he put on his sunglasses and walked out the door,” she told the Post.Clinton’s legal team denied her allegations, the Post reported, noting that when Jones’ attorneys had subpoenaed Broaddrick as part of Jones’ lawsuit, Broaddrick had testified in deposition that Clinton did not treat her inappropriately. She would later recant that testimony.Broaddrick told the DCNF Wednesday that failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton approached her after the alleged 1978 incident and told her, “I just want you to know how appreciative that Bill and I are for all that you’re doing for his campaign.”“She grabbed my arm very strongly and pulled me back to her, pulled me down to her face and said, ‘Do you understand everything you do?’ And at that moment in time, I thought she knew,” Broaddrick said. “To me that was a threat.”Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged threat.Millwee told Breitbart News in October 2016 that Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1980 on multiple occasions when she worked at a TV station in Arkansas in her 20’s.“He followed me into an editing room,” Millwee told the publication. “It was very small. There was a chair. I was sitting in a chair. He came up behind me and started rubbing my shoulders and running his hands down toward my breasts. And I was just stunned. I froze. I asked him to stop. He laughed.”She also described another occasion in which Clinton allegedly assaulted her:\\xa0“He came in behind me. Started hunching me to the point that he had an orgasm. He’s trying to touch my breasts. And I’m just sitting there very stiffly, just waiting for him to leave me alone. And I’m asking him the whole time, ‘Please do not do this. Do not touch me. Do not hunch me. I do not want this.’”On a third occasion, she says he “basically the same thing he did on the second time,” and later came to her apartment and repeatedly knocked on her door, calling her name and saying, “I know you are home. Please answer the door.”“I did not answer the door,” she told Breitbart. Millwee said that her grandmother was staying with her at the time because she was afraid of Clinton. The following day, Millwee said she saw Clinton at a fair and neither of them acknowledged his alleged visit the night before.The alleged incident was “the final straw” for Millwee, who told Breitbart that she decided to leave her job at the station.Millwee had formerly written about Clinton allegedly touching her inappropriately, flirting with her, and showing up to her house in a book she published in January 2011, Breitbart noted. The book also says that she introduced her grandmother to him at the fair, an encounter that conflicts with her story to Breitbart.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'A spokesman for Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem spoke out Wednesday against what he called “conservative cancel culture” as the governor faces criticism for failing to sign a bill banning biological males from women’s sports.“Governor Noem is very used to fighting off criticism from the left,” Noem spokesman Ian Fury said in a Wednesday email. “After all, in the past year, she was the only governor in the entire nation to never order a single business or church in her state to close. The left bullied her incessantly, but she didn’t cave.”“But if any number of conservative pundits are to be believed, that same governor who refused to cave is now caving to the NCAA and Amazon on the issue of fairness in women’s sports. What? Apparently, uninformed cancel culture is fine when the right is eating their own,” Fury said.Noem sparked a backlash among conservatives when she sent South Dakota’s House Bill 1217, which bans biological males from participating in women’s high school sports, back to the state legislature last week with suggestions.The Daily Caller News Foundation\\xa0previously reported\\xa0that the governor was wavering in her support for the legislation due to pressure from various groups in South Dakota. Though Noem\\xa0said as recently as March 8 that she was “excited” to sign the bill, her Fury told the DCNF Friday morning that the governor was still weighing the bill.Fury conceded Wednesday that Noem did indeed face “tremendous pressure from corporate bigwigs and the radical left alike to veto the bill,” but said that Noem “didn’t do that.”“Instead,” he said, “she returned it to the legislature with suggested changes because she wants these fundamental protections to pass and to survive a legal challenge.”The Noem spokesman argued that a “less impassioned review of the facts tells a much different story,” noting that Noem has long pushed for fairness in women’s sports. (RELATED: Conservatives Accuse Noem Of ‘Political Theater’ Over Bill Banning Biological Males From Women’s Sports)“3 years ago, Governor Noem was the only public official to stand\\xa0with 4-H rodeo when the USDA (under the Trump administration no less) tried to force boys and girls to compete against each other,” Fury wrote. “She won that fight and protected fairness.”“She’s carrying that effort forward today,” he continued. “But we need to be strategic in our approach to such an important issue.”During her Monday press conference, Noem brought forward athletes to discuss the importance of keeping biological males out of women’s sports and re-iterated her reasons for sending the bill back to the South Dakota legislature with suggestions regarding the bill’s language.The governor said she hopes that the adjustments she requested will be made, noting that legal experts told her that the bill in its present form would subject South Dakota to lawsuits the state could not win.“I’m still incredibly excited to sign this bill,” Noem said.

Noem said Monday she hopes the coalition could grow large enough that the NCAA “cannot possibly punish us all.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Devin Nunes, said in a recent interview that Republicans strategized the release of a February 2018 memo regarding the dossier in hopes that Schiff would release a rebuttal memo of his own.“Adam Schiff took the bait and put so much more information in his memo than we did in ours, because we knew we would be able to use that information later and prove how wrong they were. It would just take a little bit of time,” Patel said in an interview for The Epoch Times’ “American Thought Leaders.”“So that was the strategy behind it.”In their memo, Republicans said that the FBI failed to verify allegations in the dossier before using the salacious document to obtain spy warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Republicans also accused the FBI of failing to disclose that the Clinton campaign and DNC funded the dossier, which was authored by former British spy Christopher Steele.\\xa0(RELATED: FISA Report Undercuts ‘Schiff Memo,’ Which Defended FBI And Steele Dossier)WATCH:Patel said that his team decided while writing their memo that they would spring the document on Democrats during a committee meeting in January 2018.“What I said was, ‘Okay, let’s also be a little strategic about this, because if we write one, they’re going to want to write one, which is okay,'” Patel said.“Let’s bait them into it. Let’s not tell them yet. We’ll follow the rules and inform them at a committee hearing,” Patel recalled telling his colleagues.Patel said that Democrats were “shocked” that Republicans had been working on the memo.Schiff and Democrats on the Intelligence panel responded as Patel had hoped by releasing a 10-page memo of their own rebutting the Republican document.A report from the Justice Department’s inspector general (IG) released on Dec. 9, 2019, punched several holes in Schiff’s memo.It said that the FBI made at least 17 “significant” errors and omissions in applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against Carter Page. The report also said that the Steele dossier was a “central and essential” aspect of the FISA applications.Schiff had insisted in his memo that the FBI “did not…omit material information.” Schiff’s memo also said that the FBI made only “narrow use” of the Steele dossier, and that the bureau undertook a “rigorous process” to validate Steele’s claims.The IG report and a report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller debunked the dossier’s core allegation of a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” between the Trump campaign and Russian government.Schiff was an early proponent of the collusion conspiracy theory. In March 2017, he said that he had seen “more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.A spokesman for Schiff did not respond to a request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

As part of the project, Fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele to conduct the investigation.Perkins Coie paid Fusion GPS just over $1 million for the project.Elias “vigorously” denied any involvement in the dossier before it was reported that the Clinton campaign and DNC had funded the project. A New York Times reporter said in October 2017, after details of the dossier were first revealed, that Elias had falsely told him he had no link to the dossier.The dossier’s most significant claims remain either uncorroborated or have been discredited outright. Steele claimed in the dossier that the Trump campaign was involved in a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election.Federal investigators ultimately found no evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Kristi Noem Wavers On Bill Banning Biological Males From Women’s Sports)“Presumably, this requirement was included to address a student taking these drugs as a part of a gender transition, but House Bill 1217 is not limited in this way,” she continued. “Rather, if a male student athlete failed to make the football team, and later learned that another student on the team was taking steroids without disclosing it, the student who didn’t make the team would be entitled to sue both the school and the steroid-using student for damages.”Noem’s comments followed a Friday morning report from the Daily Caller News Foundation that the governor was wavering in her support for the legislation due to pressure from groups in South Dakota.The South Dakota Republican said as recently as March 8 that she was “excited” to sign the bill, which was sent to her desk on March 10, but has since suggested that she may not sign it.“Governor Noem is still weighing 106 pieces of legislation that have action due next Friday, and that is one of them,” Noem’s communications director Ian Fury told the DCNF Friday morning.Screenshot, Twitter.American Principles Project (APP) Director of Policy and Government Affairs Jon Schweppe told the DCNF that the governor faces pressure from the NCAA, the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce, and an Amazon plant in Sioux Falls, which is “quietly threatening” to leave over the bill, the APP leader told the DCNF.Schweppe warned “she’s already kind of backtracking and preparing the stage for a veto.”“I’m hoping she doesn’t do that because she will destroy her political career,” Schweppe told the DCNF. “She’s trying to become president or have a national profile.”Noem also suggested that Section 2 of the bill “creates an unworkable administrative burden on schools, who under its terms must collect verification forms from every student athlete, every year, as to age, biological sex, and use of performance-enhancing drugs.”The governor further said that HB 1217’s approach is “unrealistic in the context of collegiate athletics.” (RELATED: 53% Of Americans Support Banning Trans Athletes From Women’s Sports, Poll Shows)“In South Dakota, we are proud of our universities’ athletic programs, and in particular the great strides we have taken to gain national exposure and increase opportunities for our next generation over the past two decades,” she continued.“South Dakota has shown that our student athletes can compete with anyone in the country, but competing on the national stage means compliance with the national governing bodies that oversee collegiate athletics,” Noem said. “While I certainly do not always agree with the actions these sanctioning bodies take, I understand that collegiate athletics requires such a system – a fifty-state patchwork is not workable.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It removes the deadline for the ERA’s ratification which had expired in the 1980’s when it was not ratified by 38 states, as was required by the constitution.Conservative leaders and pro-life activists have condemned the ERA for years, warning that among other dangers, it would enshrine a right to abortion into the Constitution, remove gender-specific protections for women, and force women to participate in the draft. (RELATED: Abigail Shrier: Equality Act Supporters ‘Don’t Care’ About Girls, They Fear Being Called A ‘Transphobe’)Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the amendment in 2020 after Nevada and Illinois ratified it, the Times reported, but the amendment will need more Republican senators to support it if it is to pass the Senate.U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) (C) and representatives of women’s groups hold a rally to mark the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) outside the U.S. Capitol March 22, 2012 in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)House Democrats dressed in white, the color of suffragists, as they voted on the amendment Wednesday.“I wish that I could tell you that we had more Republican support,” Republican Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said during a Wednesday news conference, according to the Times. “Hopefully we’ll be able to get some traction over here.”“It is time for us to stop with the excuses, it is time to do what’s right and make sure that women are in the Constitution,” said Democratic California Rep. Jackie Speier. “Just make us equal under the law.”Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly was instrumental in defeating the ERA when it was first proposed, leading strong opposition against the amendment in the 1970s and 1980s. Her daughter, Anne Schlafly Cori, told The Federalist last week that “nothing in ERA would provide any additional rights for women.” (RELATED: Phyllis Schlafly’s Daughter Calls Out ‘Mrs America’ For ‘Fictionalized,’ Agenda-Driven ‘Slurs’ Against Her Family)“It would actually harm women, particularly vulnerable and at-risk women, by eliminating single-sex correctional facilities and shelters, labor laws that favor women and pregnancy accommodations, school athletics and privacy, government set-asides and programs for women,” Cori wrote. “ERA would also require girls to register for the selective service and be subject to military combat. ERA lost in the 1970s because American women did not want to lose rights.”Pro-life activists have long condemned the ERA. Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a Wednesday statement that the ERA might as well be called “the Abortion Rights Act.” Dannenfelser emphasized that the ERA would enshrine the right to abortion in the U.S. constitution “alongside the foundational principles of our great nation.”“Abortion is the greatest violation of human rights in our day — the clear antithesis of equality,” Dannenfelser said. “Its ratification would mean the indefinite blocking of state and federal policy to protect the rights of children in the womb. ”Douglas D. Johnson, who direct’s the National Right to Life Committee’s ERA project, suggested that mainstream media has promulgated a narrative “promoted by ERA activists and associated Hollywood stars, backed by a bevy of ambitious politicians.”This narrative, according to Johnson, is that “after a hundred-year struggle, the 1972 ERA is on the verge of becoming part of the Constitution.”“But the ERA-is-alive drive is really a political pressure campaign, dressed up in legal terminology,” Johnson said. “Pro-ERA and pro-abortion advocacy groups, Democratic congressional leaders, and Democratic attorneys general hope to intimidate the federal courts into permitting them to air-drop the long-expired ERA into the Constitution. We take seriously this well-resourced effort to evade constitutional requirements, but their scheme is unlikely to ultimately succeed.”The vote on the ERA occurred the same day that senators debated the Equality Act during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill.The Equality Act, or H.R.5,\\xa0would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act with the stated purpose of preventing “discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation.” Should it pass, the legislation would touch a variety of hot button topics including abortion, marriage, family, gender, sexuality, biological males in women’s sports and locker rooms, and more.Under the Equality Act, individuals who identify as another gender cannot be denied access to the locker room of their choice. It would also prevent Americans from using the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 to challenge and defend against any provisions in the Equality Act that violated their religious freedoms.The legislation\\xa0passed\\xa0the House of Representatives Feb. 25.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Republican Senators Push Biden Nominee Becerra On His Abortion Record)Becerra faced strong opposition from pro-life activists, faith leaders, and Republican lawmakers, who previously warned that the California attorney general is “an extreme political activist” and \\xa0“an enemy to every pro-life policy and law.” Despite this opposition, the senate confirmed the California attorney general as HHS secretary on Thursday, making him the nation’s first Latino to lead HHS.I’m honored and humbled by today’s vote in the Senate. Thank you. I’m ready to get to work at @HHSgov.— Xavier Becerra (@XavierBecerra) March 18, 2021 Republican Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton similarly condemned Becerra’s confirmation, saying in a Thursday statement: “Becerra is an unrepentant advocate of California-style lockdowns, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand. His confirmation will damage the country.”Catholic Vote President Brian Burch called Becerra a “culture warrior” and an “extreme left-wing ideologue.”(RELATED: Over 60 Pro-Life Leaders Call On Senate To Reject Biden Nominee Becerra Over ‘Radical Abortion Views’)“Xavier Becerra’s confirmation as Secretary of Health and Human Services poses a clear and present danger for Catholics and all people of faith,” Burch said in a statement. “Given his record of aggressive hostility to free speech, health care freedom, and the traditional values of marriage, family, and the sanctity of life, Americans must be prepared for what is coming.”Becerra “has repeatedly trampled on our most fundamental constitutional rights,” Burch said. “We can only assume Becerra’s clear contempt for religious freedom will continue in his new role.”Becerra repeatedly said during his confirmation hearings that he would follow the law in response to questions from Republican senators about abortion policy, evading questions on his support for partial birth abortion and tax payer funding of abortions.Responding to a question from Republican Utah Sen. Mitt Romney on partial birth abortion,\\xa0Becerra said:\\xa0“I have worked, as I have mentioned, for decades trying to protect the health of men and women, young and old, and as attorney general, my job has been to follow the law and make sure others are following the law.”The nominee similarly responded to a question from Republican Indiana Sen. Mike Braun on taxpayer funding of abortion by saying, “I can say to you that we will follow the law when it comes to the use of federal resources. There I can make that commitment that we will follow the law.”Becerra also won Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s vital vote by promising to “uphold the law” on the Hyde Amendment. (RELATED: CatholicVote Appeals To Sen. Manchin’s Faith, Calls On Him To Reject Becerra Nomination)Republican Montana Sen. Steve Daines, founder of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, promised to counteract Becerra’s potential pro-abortion actions from HHS“Xavier Becerra has made a career out of defending the abortion industry and promoting far-left priorities like free healthcare for illegal immigrants,” Daines said Thursday. “He has shown that he will take this agenda so far as to infringe on religious freedoms.”Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser and National Right to Life president Carol Tobias also highlighted that Becerra is “deeply out of step” with Americans on abortion.“The Biden-Harris administration has dropped all semblance of the ‘unity’ they once promised. To carry out the Administration’s extreme abortion goals, Senate Democrats have pushed through Xavier Becerra to lead the federal agency at the center of determining abortion policy,” Dannenfelser said in a statement.Tobias called Becerra “unqualified” to lead HHS, adding that he has “no health care experience but plenty of abortion advocacy.” (RELATED: Little Sisters Of The Poor Battle Democratic AGs Over Birth Control Mandate)“HHS plays a critical role in the distribution of the COVID vaccines and the production of those vaccines,”\\xa0Tobias continued.\\xa0“Becerra’s lack of healthcare experience clearly disqualifies him from leading the nation’s healthcare agency.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(Photo by JIM WATSON,SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)Biden went on to blame the Trump administration for the potential delay, arguing the withdrawal would be going according to schedule if Trump had not dragged down the transition process.The U.S. currently has 3,500 troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq, the lowest number since the decades-long conflict began.Biden has altered or outright cancelled some of Trump’s last minute troop movements, most notably his withdrawal of troops from Germany. Biden froze the withdrawal soon after gaining office in early February. Biden also ended the Trump administration’s support for “offensive operations” in Yemen, where a civil war is currently raging.Trump had sought the withdrawal from Germany due to what he called the nation’s “delinquency” in defense payments to NATO.“We don’t want to be the suckers anymore,” Trump told reporters at the time. “The United States has been taken advantage of for 25 years, both on trade and on the military. We’re protecting Germany, so we’re reducing the force because they’re not paying the bills. It’s very simple. They’re delinquent. So we’re reducing the force.

Biden has repeatedly denied\\xa0the assault and said it “absolutely did not happen.”Reade previously told the DCNF in an exclusive April 2020 interview that “Biden is like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”“He’s championing supposedly women’s rights but in his personal life that is not the way he’s conducted himself,” she said. (RELATED: National Archives Debunks Biden’s Claim, Says Senate Docs Related To Tara Reade Are Kept Elsewhere)At the time, Reade lamented that her sexual assault accusation had become a “partisan tool,” saying that Republicans weaponized her and Democrats both ignored and discredited her.“It’s inexcusable,” she told the DCNF in April 2020. “I’m sorry that I’m politically inconvenient but my perpetrator was Joe Biden. And people need to deal with it.”Her accusations garnered national attention in late April and early May, but subsequent news stories regarding Reade’s academic credentials, alongside testimony from former staffers, called her credibility into question. An Antioch University spokeswoman told Politico that Reade didn’t graduated from the college nor serve on its faculty as she claimed.Records provided by Reade from both her college and law school show that the situation is not as clear. The documents, the Intercept reported Monday, are consistent with Reade’s story that her graduation from Antioch University was handled in a unique and discreet manner tied to her legal name change due to domestic violence. The documentation also complicates an assertion from The New York Times that Reade deliberately lied about her undergraduate degree.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Kavanaugh denied her allegations, and those of several other accusers as he defended himself in confirmation hearings broadcast around the world.The Senate Judiciary Committee released a final report on the FBI investigations into Kavanaugh’s alleged misconduct in November 2018, announcing that it found “no evidence” to corroborate the claims against him. But some Democrats argued that the FBI did not conduct a complete background check on Kavanaugh and, as the Guardian noted, did not interview Ford and Kavanaugh as part of the investigation.Whitehouse’s letter argued that some people were unable to share their witness accounts with the FBI.\\xa0 (RELATED: Here’s A Timeline Of The 2018 Kavanaugh Confirmation)WASHINGTON, DC – SEPTEMBER 27: Judge Brett Kavanaugh is sworn in before testifying during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his nomination be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\\xa0 (Photo By Tom Williams-Pool/Getty Images)“This was unique behavior in my experience, as the Bureau is usually amenable to information and evidence; but in this matter the shutters were closed, the drawbridge drawn up, and there was no point of entry by which members of the public or Congress could provide information to the FBI,” Whitehouse said in a letter to Garland.He demanded answers on “how, why, and at whose behest” the FBI conducted this investigation.

It cannot and should not be the policy of the FBI to not follow up on serious allegations of misconduct during background check investigations.”Whitehouse did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.'},\n",

The Biden administration announced it would reverse the policy the next day.“He started his day attending church with his family this morning,” Psaki continued. “But I don’t have anything more for you on that.” (RELATED:\\xa0Media Treats Catholicism In Vastly Different Ways Depending On Politics)An examination by the Daily Caller News Foundation found\\xa0that major media outlets and reporters frequently celebrate Biden’s\\xa0Catholicism as “devout” without noting the significance\\xa0of his divergence from Catholic teaching. Yet outlets and reporters also criticized the Catholicism of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett for her adherence to certain Catholic principles.Experts suggested to the DCNF in February that this framing of Biden’s faith may be an attempt to persuade the public that “Catholicism is indistinguishable” from liberal ideology.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Mike Thompson and Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath, passed 227 to 203 with eight Republicans voting in favor. If signed into law, it would mandate background checks whenever somebody purchases a gun, regardless of where they purchase it.The bill has the wide support of Democrats and gun safety groups, who have argued that universal background checks will help stop guns from coming into the possession of people who should not have them.“It has been two years since we stood together in the House chamber and voted to pass this common-sense bill,” said Georgia Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath, whose son was shot and killed in 2012. “Today, we once again take an historic step to protect our children, to protect our communities, and to save American lives.”“Joined by Democrats and Republicans, we introduce the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021 to help keep guns out of the hands of those who may be a danger to themselves or others,” Thompson said when reintroducing the bill. “Time and time again, we have seen that the American people want universal background checks, in fact public polling shows that the majority of people, Democrats, Republicans and Independents, support this.” (RELATED: Biden Pushes Gun Control On Parkland Shooting Anniversary)Rep. Lucy McBath speaks during a House Judiciary Committee hearing considering reforms to national policing practices June 17, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Greg Nash-Pool/Getty Images)Republicans, however, accosted HR 8 and HR 1446, another bill set to pass Thursday that gives the government 10 days instead of three to complete a background check when purchasing a firearm, as a direct attack on Americans’ Second Amendment rights.“Democrats in Washington, D.C. are trying to infringe upon your Second Amendment as we speak,” said Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. “I will always stand up for law-abiding citizens’ right to keep and bear arms because I know gun laws only impact law-abiding citizens, not criminals.”“Unfortunately, the Democrats in Congress are not serious about ending gun violence,” said North Carolina Republican Rep. Richard Hudson. “And it’s obvious by the bills – they’re bringing up four this week – which would do nothing to have stopped a single mass shooting in this country, yet, they threaten the rights of law-abiding citizens.”While both HR 8 and HR 1446 will both come up for votes in the Democratic Senate, it remains unlikely that they will each garner the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster.Universal background checks have enjoyed wide, bipartisan support. A 2018 Gallup poll found that 92% of voters supported requiring background checks for all gun sales, more than almost every other gun control measure.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: The House Passed H.R. 1 – Here’s What’s In It)The order will also “provide voting access and education to citizens in federal custody,” a release from the White House said.Additionally, the executive order will modernize Vote.gov, make recommendations to improve voting access to people with disabilities and those in the military, according to Politico. It also requires federal agencies to notify states about how they can do more to increase voter registration.“Every eligible voter should be able to vote and have that vote counted,” Biden said Sunday before signing the order, USA Today reported. “If you have the best ideas, you have nothing to hide. Let the people vote.”The order was signed on the 56th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery Civil Rights march, the White House noted.“The legacy of the march in Selma is that while nothing can stop a free people from exercising their most sacred power as a citizen, there are those who will do everything they can to take that power away,” Biden said in pre-taped remarks, according to Politico.\\xa0'},\n",

(RELATED: Barr Taps John Durham To Serve As Special Counsel)Durham is one of dozens of federal prosecutors resigning from office at the request of President Joe Biden. Like many of his predecessors, Biden sought resignations to appoint his own nominees to the Senate-confirmed positions.It was reported earlier this month that Biden planned to allow Durham to remain with the Justice Department as special counsel. Attorney General William Barr gave him that designation on Oct. 19, 2020.Biden is also allowing David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, to remain in office. Weiss is investigating Biden’s son, Hunter, over his foreign business dealings and taxes.Merrick Garland, the federal appeals court judge nominated to serve as attorney general, dodged questions during his confirmation hearing this week about how he will handle the Durham probe, and whether he would release a report of the investigation.Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland listens during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the Hart Senate Office Building on February 22, 2021 in Washington, DC. Garland previously served at the Chief Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. (Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images)He said he saw “no reason” why Durham would not stay on as special counsel, but he added that he will first “have to talk with Mr. Durham and understand that nature of what he’s been doing, the nature of the report.”Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Garland that his commitment to keeping Durham was “not quite as explicit” as he had hoped.Barr tapped Durham for the investigation in April 2019. The probe has largely tracked revelations from a Justice Department inspector general’s report that found that the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to obtain warrants to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.Barr has said Durham was investigating the activities of the FBI, CIA, other intelligence agencies and certain “private actors” he did not name.Durham has also looked into the creation of the dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy who investigated the Trump campaign on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The FBI relied heavily on the dossier in its applications to surveil Page, but many of its allegations have since been debunked.Durham has landed just one conviction so far in his investigation. Former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith pleaded guilty on Aug. 19, 2020, to altering an email about Page’s past affiliation with the CIA. A federal judge sentenced Clinesmith to 12 months probation last month.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'The Democratic Equality Act, which will most likely pass the House of Representatives Thursday, would impact abortion, marriage, family, gender, and more.The Equality Act passed the Democratic-led House in 2019 with support from eight Republicans and unanimous support from Democrats, making it likely that it will again pass the House, NPR reported. But the bill’s fate in the Senate is less certain since it would need 60 votes to avoid a filibuster and it is not certain how some of the more moderate Democrats and Republicans will vote on the bill.H.R.5 would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act\\xa0 with the stated purpose of preventing “discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation.” Should it pass, the legislation would touch a variety of hot button topics including abortion, marriage, family, gender, sexuality, biological males in women’s sports and locker rooms, and more.Under the Equality Act, individuals who identify as another gender cannot be denied access to the locker room of their choice.“An individual shall not be denied access to a shared facility, including a restroom, a locker room and a dressing room, that is in accordance with the individual’s gender identity,” the bill’s text reads.The bill also expands the number of businesses counting as “public accommodations,” according to the National Review, specifically referencing shelters and salons. The publication noted that women who seek to escape violent men in shelters would thus be forced to share living quarters with biological men.The bill’s reference to salons harkens back to a high profile 2019 case in which a transgender woman sued over a female salon employee’s refusal to wax the transgender woman’s scrotum, National Review reported.The legislation explicitly says that it would trump the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, meaning that Americans could not use the RFRA to challenge and defend against any provisions in the Equality Act that violated their religious freedoms.“The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title,” the legislation says.The Equality Act would redefine “sex” to include “pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition,” according to the National Review. The publication noted that federal courts have already interpreted “related medical condition” to include abortion.Those with “a related medical condition shall not receive less favorable treatment than other physical conditions,” according to the bill. The language would make it illegal, in effect, for doctors to refuse to perform abortions, according to National Review.Supporters of the legislation say it ensures that LGBTQ Americans share equal rights with their fellow citizens. These supporters herald the Equality Act as legislation that only promotes love and equality.“This is legislation that will strengthen protections for all people, including women, religious minorities, people of color, and LGBTQ people,” Ronald Newman, national political director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement last week.\\xa0(RELATED: Amazon Exposes True Colors By Silencing ‘Dissent From A New Orthodoxy,’ Author Says)“For people who live at the intersections of multiple targeted identities — particularly Black transgender women — discrimination is a persistent and painful daily reality,” Newman said. “The Equality Act will make it clear that no one should be turned away, harassed or discriminated against because of who they are.”But critics like the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute argue that the Equality Act “attacks the lives of countless unborn children, endangers Catholic and other pro-life health care providers, provides a basis for challenging all state and federal limits on public funding of abortion, and treats religious believers as second-class citizens who must violate their fundamental moral convictions to serve the goals of the pro-abortion movement.”“This is a government using its power to tell us to bow down to the will of a cultural elite in this town who want to tell us what we’re supposed to believe.

Chip Roy Press Office (@RepChipRoy) February 25, 2021 Family Policy Alliance President and CEO Craig DeRoche told the Daily Caller News Foundation this week that the Equality Act’s sponsors so-named it to hide “what’s really lurking in it” — which DeRoche called “a broken proposal that sets us back decades when it comes to America’s long and hard-fought march toward equal justice for all.”“The bill would erase the concepts of male and female throughout the most basic parts of American life — sports, locker rooms, small businesses, classrooms, and even parent-child relationships in the home,” DeRoche said. “Most concerning of all, the Equality\\xa0Act endangers children — from the very beginning of their lives by sanctioning abortion, to childhood by pushing over-sexualized curriculum, and to adolescence by forcing children struggling with their bodies to transition away from their biological sex.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: New DCCC Hire Who Admitted To Shootings, Drug Dealing Called Cops ‘White Supremacists’)Maloney said that none of the bills that Democrats have passed so far this year “had anything to do with socialism or defunding the police.”Maloney hired Tatro, who served a 10-year prison sentence for attempted murder and drug trafficking, earlier this month to serve as a senior adviser for outreach to the DCCC, which helps Democrats in House races.The committee came under criticism over the hiring, both because of Tatro’s violent criminal history, and his extremist views on policing.The New York Post first reported that Tatro was considered the “triggerman” for the Original Gangsta Killas gang in Albany, N.Y.The Post reported that Tatro confessed to a “razor slashing” in 2002, and to shooting two rival gang members. He was sentenced to prison for attempted murder in the shooting in 2006.

The former vice president cited attacks on abortion legislation from GOP lawmakers as a reason for his switch.Kamala Harris, now vice president in the Biden administration, attacked him for his flip on Hyde soon after his June 2019 statement during the July Democratic presidential primary debate.

But the Senate should approve presidents’ picks to staff their administrations unless those picks are grossly unqualified.”Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also condemned Manchin on Twitter for voting to confirm former United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions but expressing “unease” regarding Biden nominee for Cabinet Secretary Deb Haaland. If confirmed, Haaland would be the first Native American to head the Interior Department.“Jeff Sessions was so openly racist that even Reagan couldn’t appoint him,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Manchin voted to confirm him. Sessions then targeted immigrant children for wide-scale human rights abuses w/ family separation. Yet the 1st Native woman to be Cabinet Sec is where Manchin finds unease?”Tanden formerly served as a White House aide during former President Bill Clinton’s administration. She is also the president of the Center for American Progress (CAP).The Biden nominee criticized Sanders repeatedly during his 2016 presidential campaign and accused him of undermining Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Lawmakers have also questioned how CAP obtained millions of dollars in corporate and foreign government donations during Tanden’s tenure, and Tanden pushed the now-debunked allegation that Trump conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tech companies, however, have denied that their censorship policies are politically motivated and that the beliefs of their employees guide their censorship decisions.Lawmakers from both parties have also argued that tech companies, especially Facebook, Google and Amazon, are too big, with many calling for additional governmental oversight and others calling for them to be broken up.

Joe Manchin, a Democrat, said Friday that he will vote against Tanden due to her “overtly political statements” about Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Mitch McConnell.“I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” said Manchin, a moderate Democrat. (RELATED: Manchin Opposes OMB Pick Neera Tanden)Tanden, a former Bill Clinton White House aide who is president of the Center for American Progress (CAP), has come under scrutiny because of her bombastic tweets criticizing Republicans. She also was highly critical of Sanders during his 2016 presidential bid, blaming him and his supporters for undermining Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.Republicans and some progressive Democrats have also questioned millions of dollars in corporate and foreign government donations given to CAP during Tanden’s tenure. Tanden also pushed the now-debunked allegation that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.During her confirmation hearing on Feb. 9, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley quizzed Tanden over funding CAP accepted from Big Tech companies and the United Arab Emirates.Tanden apologized for her politically-tinged tweets during the confirmation hearing and denied that CAP’s funders had any influence on the think tank’s mission.President Joe Biden said Friday he has no intention of pulling Tanden’s nomination and expressed confidence that she will be confirmed to the post.“I think that we are going to find the votes and get her confirmed,” he told reporters on Friday.Tanden will need all remaining Democrats, at least one Republican, and Sanders, an Independent, to vote for her confirmation if she is to take office.Sanders, who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has not said whether he will vote to confirm Tanden. He dodged a question in an interview on CNN on Friday about whether he supports her confirmation.Many of Tanden’s supporters blasted Manchin and Republicans following his statement, with some complaining that she was the victim of sexism.Former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican who was highly critical of Trump, said on Saturday that Tanden should be confirmed. He warned Republicans that they one day will be back in power and want to confirm Cabinet and Cabinet-level nominees.But at CAP, Tanden mounted lobbying campaigns to block Trump’s cabinet picks from being confirmed.She tweeted on Feb. 8, 2017, that CAP was “proud to fight” against Jeff Sessions, who Trump picked for attorney general.@amprog is proud to fight #Sessions https://t.co/HYBPB6pecV— Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) February 8, 2017 On Jan. 18, 2017, Tanden wrote that CAP was “fighting hard against” DeVos, who would lead the Department of Education.friend, CAP is fighting hard against DeVos but keep fighting potential allies instead of Trump— Neera Tanden (@neeratanden) January 18, 2017 CAP signed a letter to the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee with 37 other progressive groups expressing “strong concerns” with DeVos’s nomination.On Jan. 6, 2017, CAP published a column from one of its senior fellows opposing Tillerson’s nomination to lead the State Department.“The next U.S. secretary of state must, as Secretary John Kerry has, protect U.S. foreign policy and security interests and demonstrate a track record of personal and diplomatic credibility,” wrote Cathleen Kelly, a CAP senior fellow.“President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for the job, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, does not meet those qualifications.”On Jan. 18, 2017, CAP fellow Colin McArthur called for an investigation into whether Steven Mnuchin committed “any illegalities” when he ran OneWest Bank.Tanden and CAP’s efforts were futile as all of the Trump nominees were confirmed.CAP did not respond to a request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Lincoln Project also announced Monday that it hired the law firm Paul Hastings for a “comprehensive review of” the organization’s “operations and culture” — though several senior partners at Paul Hastings have donated to the organization.The IRS also authorized a $389,420 federal tax lien seven years ago against Wilson’s Florida home in response to his unpaid taxes that dated back to 2004, the Free Beacon reported.Wilson, who has not responded to requests for comment from the DCNF, started a GoFundMe campaign after President Donald Trump’s election to produce the film “Everything Trump Touches Dies.” The campaign raised almost $65,000, but the film was never made.Screenshot, GoFundMe.Firms controlled by the Lincoln Project’s leaders received $50 million dollars of the Lincoln Project donations, the Associated Press reported earlier this month, leaving tens of millions to go towards production costs, overhead, and consulting fees that members of the group collected.Campaign finance disclosures show that most of the Lincoln Project’s cash was split among Lincoln Project founders’ firms, according to the AP. This includes $27 million to co-founder Reed Galen’s company and $21 million to former Lincoln Project member Ron Steslow’s boutique firm.The Lincoln Project masked how much money it earned through strategies similar to ones used by the Trump campaign, the AP reported. Weaver and Wilson were likely paid as subcontractors to several firms that collected payments, though they were not listed in publicly available records, according to the AP. The publication noted that co-founder Steve Schmidt collected $1.5 million in December 2020 but returned the sum.The Lincoln Project also has helped out founders who were suffering financially, the AP reported. Weaver paid off $313,000 in back taxes dating back to 2011 that he owed to the IRS, according to the publication, and still owes $340,000 in back rent in Texas after his family had to shut down a children’s boutique that they ran.Though Lincoln Project co-founders have repeatedly insisted that the organization was unaware of allegations against Weaver until January 2021, multiple sources\\xa0came forward Monday\\xa0after they were released from their NDA’s and\\xa0told 19th News that Lincoln Project managing partner Sarah Lenti knew about allegations as early as May 2020. The sources also told the publication that Schmidt and Galen were among the co-founders who knew.Lenti told 19th News that Lincoln Project co-founders knew about the allegations even earlier — in March 2020. \\xa0(RELATED: Lincoln Project Scrambles To Clean Up John Weaver Mess, Publishes Former Employee’s Private Messages)Schmidt had previously said he was unaware of the allegations until January, according to 19th News.

Elizabeth Warren. High-profile progressives including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal and others also called for more student debt forgiveness, arguing that Biden could do so through an executive order.“Canceling $50,000 in federal student loan debt will help close the racial wealth gap, benefit the 40% of borrowers who do not have a college degree, and help stimulate the economy,” Schumer and Warren said in a joint statement. “It’s time to act. We will keep fighting.”“POTUS does have the authority to #cancelstudentdebt with the stroke of a pen,” said Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “He can and must use it. The people deserve nothing less.”“The president has the authority to cancel $50K in student debt right now,” Jayapal said on Wednesday, calling on Congress to pass legislation doing so if Biden did not on his own.\\xa0(RELATED: Biden Extends Student Loan Payment Freeze Until September)President Joe Biden holds a face mask as he participates in a CNN town hall at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, February 16, 2021.

       "  'full_article_text': 'New rules from the Chinese government indicate that China will exercise control over the appointment of Catholic clergy without any input from the Vatican.The “Administrative Measures for Religious Clergy,” which will go into effect May 1, clarified that the state-run Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA) will select candidates for clergy who will then be “approved and \\xa0consecrated by the Chinese Catholic Bishops’ Conference.”The rules, translated by the religious persecution publication Bitter Winter, make no mention of the Vatican’s role in appointing bishops, despite a deal brokered between Pope Francis and the Chinese government by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin. The 2018 agreement ended\\xa0a decade-long power struggle between the Chinese government and the Catholic Church on whether the Chinese government has the power to appoint Catholic bishops.Under the conditions of the deal, Pope Francis recognized the legitimacy of seven bishops selected and appointed by the authoritarian Chinese government — though the Chinese government has persecuted\\xa0Christians for decades, particularly after Communists took control of China in 1949.Chinese Catholics have practiced their faith through underground churches to avoid arrest, led by Catholic bishops appointed by past popes. The Chinese government continues to harass, detain, and arrest Chinese Catholics, priests, and nuns. (RELATED: Here’s Why Authors, Theologians Think Pope Francis Cooperates With The Chinese Government Despite Persecution Of Christians)The Vatican agreement with China caused widespread confusion among faithful Catholics and Catholic leaders, many of whom quickly denounced the deal. The former archbishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal Joseph Zen, called\\xa0the agreement “an incredible betrayal,”\\xa0adding\\xa0that “a church enslaved by the government is no real Catholic Church.”“If I were a cartoonist I would draw the Holy Father on his knees offering the keys of the kingdom of heaven to President Xi Jinping and saying, ‘Please recognize me as the pope,’” Zen wrote in an October 2018 New York Times op-ed.VATICAN CITY, VATICAN – OCTOBER 22: Pope Francis, flanked by the Prefect of the Pontifical House and former personal secretary of Pope Benedict XVI (Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty Images)According to Zen, Pope Francis comes from Argentina where military governments and the rich oppressed the poor together. Communists would “come out to defend the poor,” and Zen said this may have caused Francis to have a natural sympathy for these communists. But Zen says that Francis does not know them as the “persecutors they become once in power, like the Communists in China.”The Daily Caller News Foundation spoke to a number of Catholic authors and theologians in January 2020 regarding Francis’s silence on Chinese persecution, and why the pope aligned the Catholic Church with the Chinese government in the first place.\\xa0 Catholic author and commentator Phil Lawler told the DCNF at the time that “dealing with Beijing is dangerous, because they’re determined to control the Church.”“Cardinal Parolin was given a mandate by the\\xa0Pope to get a deal done. So he shut out those (like Zen) who voiced reservations that would slow progress toward a deal,” the author explained. (RELATED: Jesuit Priest’s Comment On Homosexuality Unveils The ‘Most Insidious Problems Facing All Christians Today,’ Theologian Says)“Pope\\xa0Francis wants the Catholic Church to operate freely in China, which will be possible only if the regime allows it,” Lawler told the DNCF. “He’s willing to sacrifice doctrinal clarity — something that’s never been important to him — toward that end. So that’s what is happening now. The Catholics who cling to doctrine are being suppressed; the regime is getting what it wants.”Lawler warned the DCNF that Francis’s dealings with China are yet another illustration of how Pope Francis will not tolerate dissidence.“For all his talk about frank discussion and decentralization of authority, in practice Pope Francis demands adherence to his own policy line, and anyone who voices reservations is treated as an enemy,” Lawler said.Pope Francis has not yet commented on the new rules from the Chinese government, though he may do so in his weekly audience Wednesday. The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I can do better, and I will do better, for the women of Pennsylvania.”Almost six months after the incident, Garecht told the DCNF that Sims sent her a card in which he apologized for the harm he caused.

Richard Burr faces the possibility of censure by his state’s Republican Party after his vote to convict former President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6.The North Carolina GOP is set to vote on whether to censure Burr on Monday night, party spokesman Tom Wigginton told multiple local outlets. The effort to convict Trump fell 10 votes short, but seven Republicans joined all 50 Democrats in voting against his acquittal.Though Burr twice voted that the trial itself was unconstitutional, he said that he would be an “impartial juror” and judge the case on its merits once it began. Following his vote to convict, the retiring senator said that Trump “bears responsibility” for the deadly Jan. 6 riot.“The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a coequal branch of government and that the charge rises to the level of high Crimes and Misdemeanors,” Burr said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. “Therefore, I have voted to convict.”Pro-Trump rioters gather in front of the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Jon Cherry/Getty Images)The backlash among North Carolina Republicans was swift. North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said that Burr’s vote to convict “in a trial that he declared unconstitutional is shocking and disappointing,” and multiple Republicans vying to succeed him publicly rebuked his decision.“Wrong vote, Sen. Burr,” wrote former Republican Rep. Mark Walker. “I am running to replace Richard Burr because North Carolina needs a true conservative champion as their next senator.” (RELATED: Mark Walker Running For Senate In North Carolina)Following Burr’s vote, South Carolina Sen.

The institute, also known as Hanban, is affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Education.Many of Hanban’s directors are members of the Chinese Communist Party or have close ties to the organization, The Daily Caller has previously reported.The Trump-era proposal was withdrawn from consideration on Jan. 26, according to information at RegInfo.gov, the website for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which operates under the Office of Management and Budget and the White House.The OIRA website does not provide any other information about the proposal, or why it was tabled. The website does say that at any point in the review process for a proposed rule, “an agency may withdraw its rule from review and choose not to move forward with it or to resubmit it after further consideration.”China’s Vice President Xi Jinping unveils the plaque at the opening of Australia’s first Chinese Medicine Confucius Institute at the RMIT University in Melbourne on June 20, 2010. (WILLIAM WEST/AFP via Getty Images)A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of DHS, confirmed that the rule was withdrawn on Jan. 26.The spokesperson did not elaborate on the reason for withdrawing the rule, and declined to speculate on whether the Biden administration will re-submit it.“ICE does not speculate about future pre-decisional proposed rules or policies,” the spokesperson told The Daily Caller News Foundation.President Joe Biden has pledged to review and potentially nullify many of President Trump’s executive orders, particularly those related to immigration issues, which fall under the control of DHS.Axios reported on Jan. 11 that the Trump administration was trying to push through a rule that would require colleges and K-12 schools to disclose any financial ties to Confucius Institutes. The story noted that Biden could quickly undo the rule once he took office.

President Donald Trump asked 46 Obama-era holdovers to tender their resignations on March 10, 2017. The maneuver generated some scrutiny for Trump even though the decision was not unprecedented.CNN at the time blared the headline, “Anger mounts over handling of US attorney firings.”Their headline for the Biden story reads, “DOJ to ask Trump-appointed US attorneys to resign.”President Biden has pledged to not interfere in the investigation into Hunter Biden’s finances, though he has said that he is “confident” that his son did nothing wrong.

Horowitz found that the FBI made at least 17 “significant” errors and omissions in applications for warrants to surveil Trump campaign aide Carter Page.Many of the errors involved the FBI’s handling of the Steele dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.Durham’s investigation has led to only one conviction, much to the disappointment of Trump supporters.

Ted Brindisi.Brindisi trails Republican challenger Claudia Tenney by a razor-thin margin of 122 votes. Tenney declared victory in the race on Tuesday, but the state has not certified the results while the legal challenge unfolds.Elias called on the state court to order a hand count of the vote, claiming that there is “mounting evidence of significant irregularities in the tabulation of ballots.” (RELATED: Lawyer Behind Steele Dossier Cried About ‘Secret Russian’ Connection)The filing, reported by Breitbart News, reads:In this case, there is reason to believe that voting tabulation machines misread\\xa0hundreds\\xa0if not\\xa0thousands\\xa0of valid votes as undervotes, (supra\\xa0at 4), and that these tabulation machine errors disproportionately affected Brindisi, (id.). In addition, Oswego County admitted in a sworn statement to this Court that its tabulation machines were not tested and calibrated in the days leading up to the November 3, 2020 General Election as required by state law and necessary to ensure that the counts generated by tabulation machines are accurate.Elias asserted that voting machines may have undercounted up to 2,599 votes for Brindisi throughout the district.The analysis is based on analysis of results from a recount of 1,127 votes in December. According to Elias, a hand count showed that Brindisi had nine more votes than were registered by the voting machines. Applying the same error rate to the more than 325,000 votes cast in the election, Elias claimed that Brindisi may have been robbed of as many as 2,599 votes.“That figure far exceeds the margin between the two candidates in this race, and based on this small sample size at least, appears to disproportionately affect Brindisi,” the Perkins Coie team wrote in their filing.According to The Washington Times, the machines in question were manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, the same company that has sued conservatives over their allegations about voting fraud.Dominion sued Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani on Jan. 25 for $1.3 billion for what the company said were his “demonstrably false” statements about its voting machines. The company sued attorney Sidney Powell on Jan. 8 for libel over similar claims.Dominion did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Elias’s allegations.Elias has previously fueled unfounded conspiracy theories.He gained notoriety during the Trump administration after it was revealed that he hired Fusion GPS to investigate the Trump campaign in a project that led to the infamous Steele dossier, which alleged that the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election. Elias hired Fusion on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, which Perkins Coie represented.An investigation by the special counsel’s office found no evidence of a Trump-Russia conspiracy.A lawyer for Tenney did not respond to a request for comment about Elias’s court filing.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Utah Sen. Mitt Romney on Thursday unveiled an ambitious plan to pay families up to $350 per month per child, a measure which the Republican says will promote marriage and help alleviate child poverty without adding to the federal budget deficit.The proposed bill, The Family Security Act, goes even further than one from Democrats to increase child tax credits as part of a coronavirus stimulus bill. Democrats have proposed increasing the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600, and allow for payouts to be distributed before families file their taxes.Romney proposes paying families $350 per month for each child up to five years old, and $250 per month for children between 6 and 17 years old.The proposed maximum payment would be $1,250, or the equivalent of five school-aged children.\\xa0The monthly stipend would begin to phase out at $400,000 for families with joint tax filings, and $200,000 for single filers.“Romney’s proposal would ensure that expecting parents receive the help they need to face expenses associated with preparing for a child, and low-income families would no longer have to choose between a bigger paycheck or maintaining eligibility for support,” Romney’s office said in a statement announcing the proposed measure.

Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Kellyanne Conway, participates in a listening session on youth vaping and the electronic cigarette epidemic\\xa0 (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images)Romney says that the plan would “immediately” pull nearly 3 million children out of poverty. He claims it will not increase the federal deficit.“American families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low,” Romney said.Monthly payments would be routed through the Social Security Administration rather than the IRS, according to the proposal.A summary of Romney’s plan says that monthly stipends will add up to $112.5 billion each year, but will be offset by the elimination of some tax credits and deductions.Romney proposes the elimination of the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT), which allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes from their annual tax returns. President Donald Trump capped the deduction at $10,000, though some Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have called for eliminating the cap, claiming that it is unfair to residents of cities and states like California and New York, which have high state tax rates.Romney asserts that getting rid of the SALT deduction, which his plan calls “an inefficient tax break to upper-income taxpayers,” would free up $25.2 billion for his plan.The bill would also eliminate the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which adds $16.5 billion to the federal budget. Elimination of the head-of-household category for tax filings would also clear up $16.5 billion in budget space, according to Romney.Reforming the Earned Income Tax Credit will free up another $45 billion in spending, according to the Romney plan.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They noted that he has claimed that he believed the alteration to be accurate at the time.Anthony Scarpelli, an assistant U.S. attorney, said during the hearing that Clinesmith’s lies about Carter Page were “more egregious” than those told by George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide who pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI.Speaking at Clinesmith’s hearing, Page said that the “manufactured scandal and associated lies caused me to adopt the lifestyle of an international fugitive for years.”“I often have felt as if I had been left with no life at all. Each member of my family was severely impacted.”Page has sued the Justice Department, FBI, Clinesmith and other current and former FBI employees over the inaccurate FISA applications.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

CNN’s report also said that she liked a comment that said that “a bullet to the head would be quicker” to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Greene also posted about the Iran Nuclear Deal in April 2018, and somebody commented “Now do we get to hang them ??

       "  'full_article_text': 'The FBI used specialists from its Special Surveillance Group unit — sometimes referred to as “ghosts” — to track Carter Page while he was still on the Trump campaign, according to newly declassified FBI documents.The plan to surveil Page with the special investigators, known as SSGs, is laid out in an Aug. 24, 2016, memo from the FBI team investigating the Trump campaign.President Donald Trump declassified the memo and other documents during his last week in office. The memo, referred to as an operational plan, was published by Just the News.The bureau’s use of SSGs in the investigation of Page, which has not previously been reported, shows the extent to which investigators went to keep tab on the former Trump campaign adviser. The FBI also used at least one confidential human source, Stefan Halper, and court-approved wiretaps in its investigation of Page, a former Navy officer who joined the Trump campaign in March 2016.The FBI memo provides few details of its use of SSGs to follow Page. It is also unclear where the surveillance occurred. Page served as an adviser to the Trump campaign until late September 2016.The memo says: “SSG assets from [redacted] will cover CD during CD’s time in [redacted].”CD refers to “Crossfire Dragon,” the FBI’s code name for Page.The FBI uses SSGs to conduct on-the-ground surveillance of terror suspects or potential spies, both in the U.S. and abroad. Eric O’Neill, a former SSG who worked on the investigation of Robert Hanssen, an FBI official caught spying for Russia, has dubbed the special investigators “ghosts” because of the operational tactics they use to avoid detection by surveillance targets.The FBI had opened an investigation on July 31, 2016, into whether Page and three other Trump campaign advisers were working as foreign agents of Russia.Two months after the memo, the FBI obtained the first of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against Page.The FBI relied heavily on allegations from former British spy Christopher Steele in its applications for the surveillance warrants. Steele’s information has largely been undercut by multiple federal and congressional investigations, which found no evidence that anyone on the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. (RELATED: A London Meeting Before The Election Aroused George Papadopoulos’s Suspicions)The FBI memo also describes the technical preparations the FBI made ahead of meetings between Page and Stefan Halper, the FBI confidential human source.The memo said that the confidential human source (CHS), who has been identified as Halper, offered to allow the FBI to install recording devices at his home.Halper hosted Page at his home in Virginia on Aug. 20, 2016 and Oct. 17, 2016.Carter Page, one-time advisor of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump, addresses the audience during a presentation in Moscow, Russia, December 12, 2016. REUTERS/Sergei KarpukhinDuring the Oct. 17, 2016 meeting, Page repeatedly denied allegations made against him in the Steele dossier, according to another declassified FBI document.Steele, a former MI6 officer who investigated the Trump campaign on behalf of Democrats, alleged that Page met secretly in Moscow in July 2016 with Igor Sechin, the CEO of Russian oil giant Rosneft and a close ally of Vladimir Putin. Steele also claimed that Page met with a Kremlin official, Igor Diveykin, to discuss the exchange of blackmail material on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.Page told Halper that the allegations about his meetings with the Russians were a “lie.”“The core lie is that I met with these sanctioned Russian officials, several of which I never even met in my entire life, but they said that I met them in July,” he said, according to the FBI transcript.Page also denied having any knowledge about Russia’s release of Democrats’ emails.“I know nothing about that — you know, on a personal level, no one’s ever said one word to me,” he told Halper.The Justice Department’s inspector general and the presiding judge on the FISA Court blasted the FBI for withholding Page’s denials from it applications to surveil the Trump aide. The IG said that the exculpatory information should have been included in the applications.Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who took over the FBI’s investigation of Trump, concluded that there was no evidence that any Trump associates conspired with the Russian government or acted as agents of Russia.The FBI transcripts also show that Halper asked Page to facilitate an introduction to Sechin and Diveykin so that he could invite them to a conference at the University of Cambridge.Halper at the time was a professor at the historic British university. He was a founding member, along with former MI6 chief Richard Dearlove, of the Cambridge Intelligence Seminar, which hosted current and former intelligence operatives.“It would be very interesting to have them at [redacted] and to have — if you wish — for you to come, and I could invite them,” Halper told Page, according to the transcript.“It would be a very productive conversation. They’d enjoy it,” Halper added.Page told Halper his lawyers would probably advise against reaching out to Sechin and Diveykin because of the heat generated by the allegations in the Steele dossier.FBI transcript of secretly recorded conversation between Stefan Halper and Carter PageHalper circled back to Sechin and Diveykin later in his conversation with Page.“It occurred to me when I was thinking about all of this, what a wonderful event that would be,” Halper said of the potential Cambridge event.“It would be an opportunity for a Moscow-based senior person to present the argument for reduction of tensions and sort of clean slate type idea, and it could be done so that there were Brits or even Americans — I hadn’t thought of any in particular — Brits who might enter that conversation with a measure of skepticism but could be neutralized,” Halper said.Page said that he thought “this would be setting off such big alarm bells.”“Maybe you could put me in touch with them?” Halper said.“Again, I don’t have their contact details,” replied Page.“Oh okay,” said Halper, “well I could find them.”Reached by The Daily Caller News Foundation, Page called the transcript “incredible, like pretty much everything else about this saga.”Page met Halper for the first time at a political conference held at the University of Cambridge from July 10-12, 2016. Republicans have questioned the timing of the Cambridge event given that the FBI opened its investigation of the Trump campaign three weeks later.Halper contacted two other Trump campaign advisers, Sam Clovis and George Papadopoulos, as part of his duties for the FBI. He lured Papadopoulos to London in mid-September 2016 under the guise of discussing an academic paper about the energy industry. Halper paid Papadopoulos $3,000 to write the paper.A transcript of Halper’s conversations with Papadopoulos show the FBI source plied the Trump aide with questions similar to those posed to Page. Papadopoulos denied having any insight into Russia’s hacks of Democrats’ emails.During one part of the conversation, Halper told Papadopoulos that he was friends with a former Russian intelligence officer, Vyacheslav Trubnikov.Halper had hosted Trubnikov at the University of Cambridge in 2012 and 2015 and tapped him to contribute to a study he did for the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment.The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

While the moratorium will help Biden deliver on one of his signature campaign promises, it will likely be met with sharp resistance from fossil fuel industries and lawmakers who have voiced concern that Biden’s climate policies will cost thousands of jobs.Biden is expected to outline his climate change plan on Wednesday, which is centered around curbing greenhouse gas emissions and investing renewable, sustainable sources of energy.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Christopher Steele, the former British spy who authored a salacious dossier about Donald Trump, told the FBI in a 2017 interview that he considered Ivanka Trump a “good friend,” according to newly declassified FBI documents.In the interview, Steele defended Ivanka against allegations that she had received secret cash payments from Russian intelligence operatives.The allegation was found in a dossier compiled by Cody Shearer, a longtime Clinton associate who conducted a private investigation into Donald Trump’s dealings in Russia.Shearer wrote in his dossier that a source inside Russia’s intelligence service said that Ivanka received cash payments “loaded on to pallets” in Moscow, London and Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.Steele told his FBI interviewers that he doubted the allegation about Ivanka, in part because he had known her for years.“STEELE advised he believed it was doubtful that IVANKA TRUMP was collecting large amounts of money,” read the FBI notes of Steele’s interview, which was conducted on Sept. 17 and Sept. 18, 2017. (RELATED: Christopher Steele Told FBI Of Clinton Crony’s Work On Second Dossier)President Trump declassified the notes as one of his last acts before leaving office last week.“STEELE was complementary of IVANKA TRUMP and considered her a good friend,” the FBI notes say.Christopher Steele in London (VICTORIA JONES/GETTY IMAGES)“STEELE further advised that his colleagues believed he was being naive about this, but he was surprised by the reporting on IVANKA. STEELE said he was skeptical about the IVANKA part of the reporting, but he could believe the rest of the report.”It is unclear how extensively the FBI or special counsel’s team investigated Shearer’s allegations about the Trumps. Ivanka Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing, and reports from the special counsel’s office and Congress make no mention of alleged cash payments from Russia.Steele’s contact with Ivanka Trump was first revealed after the release of a Justice Department inspector general’s (IG) report on Dec. 9, 2019.Steele told investigators with the IG’s office that he had “been friendly” with a member of the Trump family for years before he began working on the dossier.Steele mentioned the relationship, which he described as “personal,” to show that he was “favorably disposed” toward the Trump family prior to his work on the dossier.News outlets reported at the time that Steele was referring to Ivanka Trump.ABC News reported that Trump and Steele met in 2007, when he would have still worked for MI6. According to ABC, the pair discussed potentially working together and met several times in New York.Some of Shearer’s allegations closely matched those from Steele’s own dossier, which he compiled on behalf of the Clinton campaign and DNC.Both documents alleged that Russian intelligence had video of Trump in a Moscow hotel room with prostitutes in 2013. Steele and Shearer also alleged that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to meddle in the 2016 election.Steele provided Shearer’s dossier to his FBI contacts on Oct. 19, 2016. He obtained Shearer’s report from Jonathan Winer, a State Department official who served as Steele’s conduit to the agency.The special counsel’s team undercut the central claim in Steele’s dossier, saying that investigators found no evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump team and Russian government to influence the election.Steele identified Shearer’s source during his FBI interviews as Ruslan Mansimov, a businessman based in Turkey who claimed to be an FSB agent.Steele said he did not know what to make of Shearer’s dossier due in part to Mansimov’s poor reputation. He said that Mansimov was “neither the most sophisticated nor impressive person,” the FBI notes say.Shearer did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

That list included:Another major story that many got wrong involved a group of students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky who attended 2019’s March for Life.A viral video took social media by storm and appeared to show a teenaged boy in a MAGA hat smirking in the face of a Native American activist. The initial captions and stories suggested that the boy, identified as Nick Sandmann, was mocking Elder Nathan Phillips — but a full video that was released later showed that Phillips had approached Sandmann intentionally, and that Sandmann and his fellow students had done nothing to provoke him. (RELATED: The Real Story Behind The Catholic School Boys And Their Dust Up With A Native American Veteran)But those weren’t the only media missteps in recent years — and there were plenty of errors that had nothing to do with Trump. Reporting on the coronavirus pandemic alone has gone down a series of rabbit holes, especially as the search for the pandemic’s origin took shape.While early reports tied the virus to a wet market, rumors quickly spread that it had originated in a lab and then leaked, perhaps due to the actions of a careless employee not observing safety protocols.The U.S. Intelligence Community quickly confirmed that such leaks were under investigation, but a number of media outlets just as quickly reported the opposite. The Los Angeles Times suggested that reports of a lab leak had “all the earmarks of a conspiracy theory.” Nature Medicine journal also dismissed the idea that the virus had come from a lab, as did The Washington Post.But months later, as more and more reports began to suggest that the lab-leak theory wasn’t as conspiratorial as some had said, the story has begun to regain some of the traction it lost. (RELATED: US Has Evidence Researchers In Wuhan Lab Fell Ill Before Coronavirus Outbreak, State Department Says)The media’s pivot to a very different kind of coverage as President Joe Biden took office may not help with any credibility issues, either.A Washington Post story was retroactively edited — several months after publication — to remove an anecdote about Vice President Kamala Harris that did not paint a flattering picture.The Washington Post’s 2019 profile of Kamala Harris and her sister Maya contained an incredibly cringe-worthy scene in which Harris seemed to mock inmates and compared the difficulties of campaigning to life in prison.It was awful.And now it’s gone.https://t.co/F8LioFu3WM— Eric Boehm (@EricBoehm87) January 22, 2021Legacy media has a trust problem right now — lots of Americans seem to believe that “the media” is playing for one political team.

Trump approved the project in 2017, but it was delayed by numerous court challenges from environmental groups and tribal nations.Biden will take “critical first steps to address the climate crisis, create good union jobs, and advance environmental justice, while reversing the previous administration’s harmful policies,” his administration said.Biden is expected to rejoin the Paris Accords once sworn in, and frequently promised to do so throughout the 2020 campaign.

It is absolutely essential for our goals to be reached,” he added.Biden also plans to halt oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and his executive order places a temporary hold on all oil and natural gas leases.It’s unknown how much oil lies within the ANWR, but oil companies have pushed to drill there for years and had the support of the Trump administration. But Biden has made moving on from fossil fuels a central part of his climate agenda, and said that he would spend up to $2 trillion to combat climate change and develop an “emissions-free power sector by 2035.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Comey briefed then-President-elect Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, about allegations contained in the dossier that the Russian government had a tape of Trump with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.Christopher Steele, a former British spy, put the allegation in a dossier that the FBI used as part of its investigation of the Trump campaign.Comey, who is on tour to promote a new book, has previously said that he had no idea by the time he was fired as FBI director whether Trump was with prostitutes in Moscow or whether Russian operatives filmed it. But in the interview with The Guardian, he said that recent developments have led him to hedge more towards believing that a tape exists.Part of Comey’s assessment appears to rely on a misinterpretation of comments from Michael Cohen, a former lawyer for Donald Trump who has since testified against his old boss.“I actually think the Senate intelligence committee report, coupled with [former Trump lawyer] Michael Cohen’s account in his book, probably makes the ‘pee tape’ stuff more likely than it was when I was fired,” Comey told The Guardian.President Donald Trump shakes hands with James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the Blue Room of the White House on January 22, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images)Contrary to Comey’s remarks, Cohen has testified before Congress that he did not believe that a tape of Trump ever existed.“I’ve heard about these tapes for a long time, I’ve had many people contact me over the years, I have no reason to believe that that tape exists,” Cohen testified in a House hearing on Feb. 27, 2019. (RELATED: Comey’s Briefing Of Trump Was Used To Collect Evidence For Russia Probe)Cohen, who pleaded guilty in the special counsel’s probe and in an investigation into his taxes conducted in New York, said he looked into allegations about a possible tape but determined that one likely did not exist.Cohen has other reasons to doubt the veracity of the dossier, which author Steele compiled on behalf of the DNC and Clinton campaign.Steele alleged in the dossier that Cohen traveled to Prague in August 2016 to meet with Kremlin insiders to pay off hackers who stole emails from Democrats in 2016.Cohen vehemently denied the allegation after the dossier was published on Jan. 10, 2017. He was vindicated by the special counsel’s report, which said that Cohen never visited Prague.The report also said that no Trump associates conspired with Russia, or aided the hacking or release of stolen emails.Igor Danchenko, a Russia analyst who was Steele’s primary source for the dossier, told FBI agents in January 2017, months before Comey was fired, that he was unable to verify the allegation about Trump with prostitutes.An inspector general’s report said that the FBI received evidence in February 2017 that the allegation about Trump may have been the product of Russian disinformation.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

His latest move could temporarily stall Mayorkas’s confirmation since defeating the hold would require 60 votes, meaning that 10 Republicans would have to join Democrats after they officially take control of the chamber on Wednesday.During the hearing Tuesday, Hawley pressed Mayorkas over how he would allocate $1.4 billion in congressionally-appropriated funds towards President Donald Trump’s border wall. While Mayorkas said that he would “follow the law,” he declined to say whether the funds would ultimately go towards the wall’s further construction.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Republican Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton faced a barrage of criticism on three occasions amid a wave of riots and a global pandemic. Yet Cotton’s allegedly controversial opinions have been largely vindicated by recent events.As a flurry of racial justice protests turned from peaceful democratic demonstrations to violent riots, Cotton penned an immediately controversial Op-Ed. In a piece published June 3 by the New York Times, Cotton argued that President Donald Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act to restore order in parts of the country set aflame by outrage and opportunism. Cotton argued that rioters were effectively encouraged by elites who labeled it an “understandable response to the death of George Floyd.”“Those excuses are built on a revolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters,” Cotton wrote. “A majority who seek to protest peacefully shouldn’t be confused with bands of miscreants.”Cotton laid out for readers a clear historical case to call in the military to assist local law enforcement in quelling the unrest–citing well-known cases, the likes of which included former President Dwight Eisenhower sending in the National Guard to ensure desegregation in Arkansas.But the Op-Ed met sharp criticism from New York Times staffers who argued the piece imperiled the lives of its black employees. Other writers blasted his piece as an idea antithetical to the constitution. NYT staff writer Roxanne Gay tweeted that the piece failed meet the criteria the paper held for amplifying a diverse range of opinions. Rather, she argued Cotton’s editorial was “inflammatory and endorsing military occupation as if the constitution doesn’t exist.”Running this put Black @nytimes staffers in danger. In solidarity with my colleagues who agree. pic.twitter.com/UfkZkE1xvj— Jenna Wortham (@jennydeluxe) June 3, 2020Following the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, tens of thousands of National Guard troops were called into action to defend Capitol grounds and various parts of Washington, D.C. to discourage further acts of insurrection. Cotton tweeted the day of the siege that “violence is unacceptable and needs to be met with the full force of the law.”The idea that the coronavirus pandemic was born of anything outside a natural phenomenon was a notion largely derided by corporate media outlets. Again, an outline of possible causes for the origin of the deadly virus tweeted by Cotton met a swift, severe rebuke. Among the four possible sources of the outbreak the Republican Senator mentioned was the possibility\\xa0 that it might be traced to a lab in Wuhan rather than animal transmission. Cotton had previously mentioned that a food market at the center of the outbreak was in close proximity to an infectious disease lab.“We don’t know where it originated, and we have to get to the bottom of that,” Cotton said in February 2020. “We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China’s only biosafety level 4 super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases.”Responding to Cotton’s comments, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Vipin Narang told the Washington Post that it was “highly unlikely” the origin of COVID-19 was a Wuhan lab–adding it is illogical to assume that the virus was in any way a “bio-weapon that Chinese developed and either purposefully or accidentally released.“Cotton should spend more time funding the agencies in the United States that can help contain and combat the virus rather than trying to assign blame,” Narang continued.But a recent report from New York Magazine’s Nicholson Baker notes that it might not be a far-fetched conspiracy to question the source of the global pandemic as anything other than the widely spread idea that the virus originated in nature.“Proposing that something unfortunate happened during a scientific experiment in Wuhan — where COVID-19 was first diagnosed and where there are three high-security virology labs, one of which held in its freezers the most comprehensive inventory of sampled bat viruses in the world — isn’t a conspiracy theory. It’s just a theory,” Baker wrote. (RELATED: Did Coronavirus Come From A Lab? Ten Key Takeaways From A Shocking New Report)Ralph Baric, a microbiologist interviewed by Baker said that a laboratory mishap leading to an outbreak was not outlandish to consider.“Can you rule out a laboratory escape? The answer in this case is probably not,” Baric said.Days before the Capitol riot, Cotton announced he would not join a group of lawmakers challenging the results of the Electoral College–a move that prompted criticism from the president. Trump assured Cotton that his decision imperiled the Arkansas Senators future, as Republican voters would remember Cotton’s decision to abandon the president’s last ditch electoral efforts.“How can you certify an election when the numbers being certified are verifiably WRONG,” Trump tweeted. “You will see the real numbers tonight during my speech, but especially on JANUARY 6th. @SenTomCotton Republicans have pluses & minuses, but one thing is sure, THEY NEVER FORGET!”Yet Cotton maintained electoral power resided with voters rather than lawmakers and added that challenging electoral legitimacy would only fuel Democrats who may want to disrupt the system.“The Founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states — not Congress,” Cotton said. “They entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the Electoral College — not Congress.”“Objecting to certified electoral votes won’t give him a second term,” said Cotton, referring to Trump. “It will only embolden those Democrats who want to erode further our system of constitutional government,” Cotton concluded.'},\n",

He was the first FBI agent to receive copies of a dossier that Steele compiled on Donald Trump as part of an investigation funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.The Senate Judiciary Committee interviewed Gaeta on March 3, 2020 as part of a GOP-led investigation into Crossfire Hurricane, the name of the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign.Sen. Lindsey Graham released transcripts of 11 interviews conducted as part of the oversight investigation on Friday.Gaeta offered a harsh assessment of Steele in the interview, according to the transcript. Gaeta’s ire stemmed from Steele’s unauthorized contact with a journalist from the liberal magazine Mother Jones, which published details from the dossier in a story on Oct. 31, 2016. (RELATED: How The Steele Dossier Spread Throughout The Media And Government)Gaeta testified that he cut Steele off as an FBI confidential human source (CHS) in a conversation after the Mother Jones story was published.“It told me that he was completely untrustworthy at that point as a source and could not be handled and would not be reliable,” Gaeta testified.Steele alleged in the dossier that the Trump campaign was engaged in a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Kremlin. The FBI relied heavily on Steele’s information to obtain surveillance warrants against Carter Page, a former Trump campaign named throughout the dossier.The dossier has come under intense scrutiny as many of its allegations have either been debunked or remain uncorroborated.A report from the special counsel’s office significantly undermined Steele’s core allegation by revealing that investigators found no evidence of a conspiracy between the Russian government and Trump campaign.Former Associate Deputy U.S. Attorney General Bruce Ohr on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., Aug. 28, 2018. REUTERS/Chris WattieRepublicans have since sought to find out how Steele compiled the dossier, and what sources he used.Gaeta, who was first introduced to Steele by now-former Justice Department official Bruce Ohr in 2010, said that until Crossfire Hurricane, Steele had been a “productive professional source.”“Nothing up until this whole thing went bad in 2016 was there any reason to believe that he was anything other than professional and productive,” Gaeta said.Steele began meeting with journalists regarding information from his dossier in September 2016. Fusion GPS, the firm that hired Steele on behalf of the Clinton campaign and DNC, arranged the briefings with reporters from The New York Times, Washington Post, New Yorker, Mother Jones and Yahoo! News.Steele did not tell the FBI about his media contacts until Gaeta confronted him after publication of the Mother Jones article.One FBI agent told the Justice Department inspector general that Steele “clearly” hadn’t been truthful with FBI agents regarding his contacts with journalists.Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham referred Steele to the FBI and Justice Department in January 2018 for possible criminal investigation into whether he made false statements to the FBI regarding his contacts with journalists.Gaeta also told the Senate panel that he warned Bruce Ohr, the Justice Department official, about Steele during a conversation just after the election in 2016.“And I said you need to know going forward we’re not going — we’re not working with him. I’m not going to talk to him again and you have to be careful when you talk to him,” Gaeta told Senate investigators.Gaeta said that Ohr, whose wife worked as a contractor for Fusion GPS, apologized for introducing him to Steele.“He goes I didn’t realize that when you called me about the article, I didn’t realize the extent of it. And then he apologizes for introducing me to Christopher Steele,” Gaeta said in the interview.Despite Gaeta’s warning and Ohr’s apology, Ohr continued serving as a conduit between Steele and the FBI, filling a role left open by Gaeta.Gaeta said that he was “surprised” to learn through media reports in 2017 that Ohr and Steele had remained in contact.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tom Cotton is leading lawmakers in calling on the Small Business Administration (SBA) to investigate allegedly illegal loans distributed to Planned Parenthood affiliates, according to a letter exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.“Planned Parenthood affiliates are well aware that they are ineligible to receive PPP loans, on the basis of SBA’s letters and the frank admission of their political action committee” the senators wrote in a Thursday letter to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza. “Their attempts to apply for PPP loans are naked attempts to defraud the United States government.”Cotton and his fellow senators emphasized that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America employs approximately 16,000 people across the nation and “jealously exercises control over local affiliates, subjecting them to uniform bylaws, accreditation, frequent reviews, and mandates about what services they must provide to remain part of the Federation, such as onsite abortion.”Since Planned Parenthood has too many employees to be eligible for Paycheck Protection Program loans, Planned Parenthood’s local affiliates are also ineligible for the loans, the lawmakers wrote\\xa0 — a fact which Planned Parenthood has already admitted.\\xa0 (RELATED: Senators Urge DOJ To Investigate Planned Parenthood For Taking Coronavirus Funding)Planned Parenthood’s Action Fund previously issued a March 25 statement\\xa0in which the organization critiqued the CARES Act legislation for giving the SBA “broad discretion to exclude Planned Parenthood affiliates and other non-profits serving people with low incomes and deny them benefits under the new small business loan program.”398323 03: A sign hangs in the offices of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America December 7, 2001 in New York City. About 200 Planned Parenthood facilities received anthrax hoax letters last month in Fed Ex packages. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)“Nonetheless, at least 37 Planned Parenthood affiliates illegally obtained more than $80 million in taxpayer funds during the initial rounds of PPP by self certifying their eligibility for the program,” the senators’ letter said. “In response, the SBA determined that these affiliates were ineligible to receive PPP loans and issued letters informing them of the consequences of false certifications of eligibility, including repayment of loans, loss of loan forgiveness, and other civil and criminal penalties.”The lawmakers stressed that SBA should notify its lenders that Planned Parenthood affiliates are ineligible for the second round of PPP loans. If a Planned Parenthood affiliate does apply for a loan, they wrote, these lenders should notify SBA immediately, and SBA should refer that affiliate to the Department of Justice for prosecution.Planned Parenthood did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the DCNF. Vice President of Government Relations and Public Policy Jaqueline Ayers previously denounced criticism of the organization in a statement provided to the DCNF.Ayers claimed that Planned Parenthood believes the affiliates were eligible for the funding in question, and that Planned Parenthood health centers play pivotal roles, particularly during the pandemic. (RELATED: Planned Parenthood Will Receive Zero Coronavirus Aid, Trump Admin Official Says)“And just like other nonprofits and health care providers, this pandemic has had a significant impact on Planned Parenthood health centers’ ability to provide care,” Ayers said in May. “Paycheck Protection Program loans have ensured health centers can retain staff and continue to provide patients with essential, time-sensitive sexual and reproductive health care during this crisis.”GOP lawmakers also urged the SBA and the DOJ in May to investigate the Planned Parenthood affiliates’ PPP loans. The lawmakers asked the DOJ to recover the funds and to “seek appropriate penalties” against Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. (RELATED: Senators Urge DOJ To Investigate Planned Parenthood For Taking Coronavirus Funding)It is unclear what steps the SBA has taken since then to investigate the Planned Parenthood loans. The organization repeatedly declined to comment on the matter to the DCNF in May, saying, “We do not comment about individual borrowers.” Planned Parenthood did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Liz Cheney — something she conceded was a rare occurrence — for taking a stand in that particular case.WATCH:“I want to just say one word about Liz Cheney who I never have agreed with her, in fact, I never really liked her at all,” Behar said, noting that Cheney might be positioning herself to run for president in the future. “I have to give her props today because 70% of Wyoming voted for Trump, so she’s really out on a limb when she goes up against him and says, we should impeach.”Similar praise for Republicans who did not jump on board Trump’s push to overturn the election have received similar accolades – and may find themselves better able to move forward in a Republican Party that is no longer led by Donald Trump.'},\n",

Reject the absurd insistence that the network has a ‘real news’ division.”\\xa0(RELATED: ‘How *Do* You Deprogram 75 Million People?’ — California Democrat Wants ‘Post WWII’-Type Re-Education For Conservatives)The Crooked Media Founder argued that Biden’s team should give his own publication, and other outlets like The Nation, “scoops and access” to help grow their audiences and “influence the way Trump’s team has nurtured fringe rags like Newsmax and OAN.”CNN’s Brian Stelter also sparked a backlash in November for compiling a list of conservative media that he claimed is spreading “disinformation” on the election.“There is an entire constellation of websites and talk shows that are in denial just like Trump,” Stelter said, showing a list of conservative media outlets that included Fox News, the Daily Caller, Newsmax, OAN, and others. “They are supplying disinformation about the election results, and wherever there’s a huge supply, there is a high demand.”\\xa0All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

While Pelosi has not personally commented on the matter, some have urged Boebert to step down and resign, reports Newsweek.The Speaker has been removed from the chambers.— Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 6, 2021The new Congresswoman fired back at those calling for her resignation, pointing out what she described as hypocrisy on the left and even with some\\xa0 Hollywood stars, in the statement issued Monday on Boebert’s Congressional website.“We should take Democrats at their word when they say never let a crisis go to waste. Their hypocrisy is on full display with talks of impeachment, censure, and other ways to punish Republicans for false accusations of inciting the type of violence they have so frequently and transparently supported in the past,” the statement reads. “And, once again, their false attacks go unchallenged. They accuse me of live-tweeting the Speaker’s presence after she had been safely removed from the Capitol, as if I was revealing some big secret, when in fact this removal was also being broadcast on TV.”Boebert then commented on the Electoral College certification objections, “They act as if Republicans created objections to the Electoral College certification out of thin air, when it was Democrats who objected in 2001, 2005 and 2017.”Democrats did have some objections in the years noted by Boebert, however, they were more limited in scope, according to Newsweek.Boebert went on to talk about a statement Pelosi made in 2018 about the family separation policy, as well as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the violence that occurred over the summer. “The reality is that Joe Biden didn’t condemn Antifa when he had a chance to, Kamala Harris spent much of the summer helping those arrested for violent behavior post bail and get back on the streets as quickly as possible, and Speaker Pelosi encouraged uprisings all over the country.”WASHINGTON, DC – JANUARY 06: In this screenshot taken from a congress.gov webcast, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) speaks during a House debate session to ratify the 2020 presidential election at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by congress.gov via Getty Images)“I denounced the violence over the summer just as I did the recent events at the Capitol. I defended our Constitution and I always will. America will persevere because freedom always prevails. But let’s get real—the far-left and their policies are causing harm to our country. I refuse to let their political machine write a narrative that millions of Americans know is false,” Boebert said in the statement. (RELATED: 84 Reps Want To Keep Ability To Carry Guns In Capitol, Say DC Is Unsafe)There is also list of quotes from Democrat politicians and Hollywood celebrities that, according to Boebert, “encourage mob violence.” The names on the list range from Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi to Johnny Depp and Madonna, reports Newsweek.An activist group out of the Congresswoman’s home state, Rural United Colorado, asked for her Congressional colleagues to expel her in a statement given last week. “Lauren Boebert has betrayed the American people and is a conspirator in the insurrection that occurred at Capitol Hill on January 6th,” the statement said. “As the citizens she represents in Congress, we cannot recall her and we cannot impeach her, but we do not accept that she is fit to represent the people of Colorado District 3 in Congress. We can only hope that her colleagues in Congress expel her.”'},\n",

A number of high-ranking Trump administration officials resigned over the president’s part in the storming of the United States Capitol building Wednesday.\\xa0(RELATED: Biden Calls Capitol Riots ‘Domestic Terrorism,’ Urged To Create White House Post Targeting Extremists)National security officials who work for this administration are being snubbed by potential employers, told they would be a “liability” and are being compared to the “Hitler Youth” https://t.co/wtF9Va53JX @laraseligman— Dave Brown (@dave_brown24) January 8, 2021 “I’ve had conversations with people who’ve worked on the national security teams, many who are career intelligence officers, who are concerned about what happens next,” said former Homeland Security and White House official Olivia Troye. “People who are hiring see everything that’s happened and have to question your morals and ethics — especially in terms of what continues to happen today — on why you chose to work for that environment.”One senior defense official who has been job searching for two years told Politico about a conversation with a potential employer in which they found out they were considered part of “Hitler Youth.” (RELATED: Liberal Media Suggests Biden Should Take Aggressive Approach To Censoring Conservative Media)“That attitude is not helpful,” the person told Politico. This official described the “Trump administration animus” that the official senses from potential employers — animus that is particularly frustrating for officials who are not “hardcore MAGA folks.”Trove said that a potential employer told her that she was a “liability.” (RELATED: ‘We Have A List’: Pundits And Democrats Plan To Hold Trump Supporters Accountable)“I can’t tell you how hurtful it was to hear that,” said Troye, describing the conversation as a reality check that “showed me firsthand the repercussions of trying to navigate” the Trump White House.Former civil servant and Homeland Security official Elizabeth Neumann, who worked in counterterrorism, told Politico that she easily found a new job after resigning from the Trump administration in April but credited this to her outspoken criticism of Trump policy.Neumann emphasized that she knew certain companies would not even consider hiring her due to her former job in the Trump administration. She noted that anyone who was associated with Trump’s controversial policies like immigration was blacklisted.“There is absolutely an effect of a number of organizations out there trying to blacklist anybody that worked on child separation,”\\xa0 Neumann told Politico.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump’s efforts to overturn the election was rejected dozens of times by state and federal courts, including twice by the U.S. Supreme Court.“There have been mountains of direct evidence that conclusively disprove Powell’s vote manipulation claims against Dominion – namely, the millions of paper ballots that were audited and recounted by bipartisan officials and volunteers in Georgia and other swing states, which confirmed that Dominion accurately counted votes on paper ballots,” the company said, adding that when it earlier asked Powell to retract her false claims, she “doubled down” and amplified them further.Powell did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Since President-elect Joe Biden won the election in November, he has been announcing the Cabinet nominees who will help him achieve his administration’s agenda.His nominees, if confirmed by the Senate after he takes office, would comprise the most diverse Cabinet in American history, a promise which Biden made while campaigning. Below is a list of who he has chosen to head departments throughout the executive branch.Biden tapped D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland to be his attorney general on Jan. 7.Garland was appointed to the circuit by former President Bill Clinton in 1997. His nomination was reported as Democrats became poised to take the Senate for the first time since 2015, potentially giving Biden enough votes to successfully appoint Garland’s eventual successor on the circuit court.Former President Barack Obama nominated Garland to the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, but he was denied confirmation hearings by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said at the time that Supreme Court vacancies should not be filled in an election year.If confirmed, Garland would immediately oversee the federal investigation into the president-elect’s son Hunter Biden over his taxes and business dealings, and a special counsel investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Biden has repeatedly said that the investigation into his son would have no bearing on his selection of an attorney general.While working in the Department of Justice, Garland prosecuted the Oklahoma City bombers and the Unabomber.During his acceptance speech, Garland said that he would not have agreed to serve had it not been for Biden’s and Vice President-elect Harris assurance that the Justice Department would remain independent.“The rule of law is not just some lawyers’ turn of phrase. It is the very foundation of our democracy,” he said.Biden tapped former Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken to be the United States’ top diplomat on Nov. 24, 2020.Blinken has long advised Biden on foreign policy, including serving as his top aide while Biden was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Blinken is a strong advocate for international alliances and coalitions, including the Paris Climate Accords, the World Health Organization and the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal. He criticized the Trump administration for its withdrawing from the Iran deal in 2018.Blinken was an advocate for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 2015 trade deal between the United States and other Pacific Rim countries intended to decrease China’s influence in the region, and criticized the Trump administration’s withdrawal from it, calling it a strategic and economic mistake.“Without U.S. leadership, China fills [the] gap and worker, environmental and intellectual property rights wane. Not in our interest,” Blinken tweeted.Blinken did, however, praise the Trump administration’s peace deals between Israel and other Middle Eastern nations in an interview with Jewish Insider.“It is good for Israel that the [Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates] are recognizing [Israel’s] existence and moving toward normalization,” he said in the October interview. “That’s a positive step and one that should be applauded and one that Vice President Biden did applaud in the moment.”Blinken added that the significance of the deals was “a little bit overstating,” noting that the countries had never actually been at war.Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken speaks after being introduced by President-elect Joe Biden as he introduces key foreign policy and national security nominees and appointments at the Queen Theatre on November 24, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware. (Mark Makela/Getty Images)Joe Biden picked retired four-star Gen. Lloyd Austin to be his secretary of defense on Dec. 8, the Daily Caller reported.Austin downplayed ISIS in 2014 and denied allegations of brushing off the terrorist group while serving as commander of U.S. military operations in the Middle East, the DCNF reported. Witnesses said he did not like to receive bad news about the campaign against ISIS because they thought his goal was to portray a “rosier” image of the conflictAustin is the only African American to have led the U.S. Central Command, according to Politico. He oversaw the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq in 2011. Biden commended him for his role in bringing 150,000 troops home from Afghanistan, the Daily Caller reported.He previously served on the board of the defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, which critics say could be a possible conflict of interest, The New York Times reported.The Alabama native would be the first black man to oversee the Pentagon if confirmed.Biden officially announced that he would nominate former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen to be his secretary of the Department of the Treasury on Nov. 30.Yellen, 74, who was the first woman to serve as Federal Reserve chair after her Senate confirmation in 2014, would be the first woman to head the Treasury Department, according to CNBC. Yellen is widely considered to be a “safe” pick with a high likelihood of confirmation by a closely divided Senate.“She’s well liked, but she gets her way,” economic-advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives founder Julia Coronado told The Wall Street Journal. “One of her underappreciated talents is the ability to drive a consensus in pretty convincing ways. She got stuff done.”Yellen will be tasked with leading the U.S. economy back from the devastating toll caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to The WSJ. Millions of Americans remain unemployed and job growth has slowed.She recently supported the idea that Congress should guide the economic recovery by increasing spending, The WSJ reported. She said it was the role of Congress to fight unemployment and support small businesses by spending more.President Donald Trump replaced Yellen with current Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell in 2018.Yellen reportedly raked in more than $7.2 million giving speeches at giant Wall Street firms including Citi and Goldman Sachs, and other large corporations including Google.U.S. Secretary of the Treasury nominee Janet Yellen speaks during an event to name President-elect Joe Biden’s economic team at the Queen Theater on December 1, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware. (Getty Images)Biden picked former Obama-era Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deputy Alejandro Mayorkas to lead the department on Nov. 23, the DCNF reported.Mayorkas previously worked in strategic counseling and crisis management for WilmerHale, an international law firm. He served as the deputy of DHS under the Obama-Biden administration from 2013-2016 and led the Office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2009-2015.The Cuban native would be the first immigrant and first Hispanic to lead DHS if confirmed by the Senate.Mayorkas reportedly lobbied the Clinton administration for clemency on behalf of a convicted cocaine trafficker while acting Los Angeles U.S. attorney, according to the Daily Caller News Foundation. The House committee called Mayorka’s advocacy “totally inappropriate” given his position.He allegedly helped Democrats like Hillary Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, obtain visas for their wealthy Chinese business partners, the DCNF reported. Republican Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Mayorkas should be disqualified from consideration due to his actions.Biden nominated California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to lead the Health and Human Services Department on Dec. 7. If confirmed, he would be the first Latino to hold the position.Becerra, a former Congressman from Los Angeles, emerged as the leading candidate for the post only a few days before he was chosen. If confirmed, he would take over a department critical to guiding the United States out of the coronavirus pandemic and responsible for overseeing the nationwide distribution of safe and effective vaccines.As the attorney general of the country’s largest state, Becerra led multiple legal efforts in defense of the Affordable Care Act and has been a vocal advocate for women’s health and abortion access.“The A.C.A. has been life-changing and now through this pandemic, we can see all the value in having greater access to quality health care at affordable prices,” he said in a Supreme Court brief in June.Becerra also said in 2017 that he would “absolutely” support Medicare-for-All, though Biden has explicitly rejected the proposal and instead favored building on the A.C.A.Biden selected Miguel Cardona, the current Connecticut education commissioner, to lead the Department of Education in his incoming administration on Dec. 22.Cardona began his career in education as a public school teacher in Meriden, Connecticut before he served as a school principal, according to his official bio. After more than a decade, Cardona transitioned to the school district’s central office to lead the work of performance and evaluation.Cardona, a former member of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), would be a great choice to lead the Department of Education because of his past union affiliation, AFT President Randi Weingarten tweeted, applauding the pick.The AFT and National Education Association, which are among the largest unions in the U.S., both endorsed Biden during the Democratic primaries in March. Weingarten said Biden shares AFT’s values in her endorsement message.“Joe Biden is the experienced and empathic leader our country needs right now,” Weingarten said in a statement.If confirmed by the Senate in 2021, Cardona will likely find himself in the middle of a school reopening fight, according to CNN. Cardona has been a strong advocate of reopening schools and has argued that virtual learning causes children to fall behind on classwork.Biden has pledged to reopen most of the nation’s schools within the first 100 days of his presidency.Dr. Miguel Cardona, US President-Elect Joe Biden’s nominee for Education Secretary, speaks during an event announcing his nomination at The Queen in Wilmington, Delaware, on December 23, 2020. (NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)Biden chose New Mexico Congresswoman Deb Haaland to lead the Interior Department on Dec. 17. If confirmed, she would be the first Native American to lead a cabinet-level agency.Haaland’s nomination was almost universally celebrated among Democrats. As Interior Secretary, she would be responsible for not only overseeing approximately 500 million acres of federal land, but would oversee the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which played a central role in the dislocation of Native Americans throughout its history.She would also be directly involved in carrying out Biden’s energy and climate agenda, including leading the effort to reinstate protections on federal lands that the Trump administration opened up to mining, logging, drilling and construction.Congresswoman Deb Haaland delivers remarks after being introduced as US President-elect Joe Bidens nominee to be the next US Secretary of Interior at the Queen Theater on December 19, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware. (ALEX EDELMAN/AFP via Getty Images)In Congress, Haaland served on the House Natural Resources Committee and has been a forceful advocate for climate change prevention and environmental preservation.“Our Interior Department will fight to address climate change and environmental injustice,” she said during her speech following Biden’s announcement of her nomination. “We will empower communities who have shouldered the burdens of environmental negligence. And we will ensure that our decisions will once again be driven by science.Haaland also made history in 2018, when she and Kansas Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids became the first two Native American women elected to Congress.Biden announced Tom Vilsack as his pick to lead the Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Dec. 9.Vilsack served in the same position — USDA secretary — for the entirety of former President Barack Obama’s presidency. He has been an adviser on agriculture and rural issues for Biden’s campaign.Vilsack previously served as governor of Iowa for two terms, according to Ballotpedia. He was also an Iowa state senator and the mayor of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. (RELATED: Biden’s Pick For USDA Chief Fought Hard Against Drug Testing For SNAP Recipients)Biden reportedly picked Vilsack due to his familiarity with the USDA’s structure and organization, Politico reported. His confirmation will also likely be swift and quick because of his experience and lack of scandals when he led the department under Obama.Vilsack made several achievements while leading the USDA, according to his official department biography. He improved U.S. conservation efforts, was involved with drawing up a trade agreement with South Korea, Colombia and Panama and invested in food assistance programs.The USDA will reportedly be a major part of Biden’s plan to address economic inequality, the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and deteriorating public health infrastructure, according to Politico. Vilsack, who was a strong proponent of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, will lead those efforts if confirmed.Biden announced he would nominate former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm to be his energy secretary on Dec. 16.Granholm, who served as governor from 2002-2010, led Michigan through the Great Recession and oversaw the recovery of the state’s auto industry, working closely with President Barack Obama to craft a bailout for General Motors and Chrysler in 2009.She championed investments in renewable energy throughout her two terms and has been a vocal advocate for its adoption nationwide since leaving office. She gave a TED Talk in 2011 discussing how investments in clean energy could accelerate states’ economic growth, mirroring what has become a central piece of Biden’s economic recovery plan, and authored an op-ed in November calling for a low-carbon recovery.Her nomination earned praise from environmental groups, who touted her record as governor and as a proponent of clean energy.If confirmed by the Senate, Granholm would be just the second woman to lead the department, which oversees a vast range of federal energy initiatives and the United States nuclear weapons complex.Biden picked Ohio Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge as his nominee for secretary of housing and urban development on Dec. 8, the Daily Caller reported.Fudge was elected to Congress in 2008 after serving as Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, according to The Washington Post.She will be the first black woman to lead the department if confirmed, the Daily Caller reported. The department is expected to return to an Obama-era push to combat racial segregation in public housing and to handle the eviction crisis caused by COVID-19, according to Politico.Fudge was chosen after Democratic Rep. James Clyburn criticized the president-elect for not choosing enough black people for cabinet positions, The Hill reported. Rep. Marcia Fudge delivers remarks after being introduced as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs at the Queen Theater on December 11, 2020 in Wilmington, Delaware. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Biden picked former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg to be his nominee for secretary of transportation on Dec. 15, the Daily Caller reported.Buttigieg suspended his presidential campaign to endorse Biden just before Super Tuesday, according to The New York Times.The 38-year-old former South Bend, Indiana, mayor and former intelligence officer in Afghanistan hosted events and fundraised for the Biden campaign after dropping out of the race, according to the Daily Caller.Buttigieg was criticized for his work at McKinsey, a global consultancy firm where he reportedly focused on paperwork instead of clientele, according to The Atlantic. He has also been criticized for failing to connect with minority voters, The New York Times reported.Biden picked former Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough to be his nominee for secretary of veterans affairs on Dec. 10, the Daily Caller reported.McDonough served as Obama’s chief of staff from 2013 to 2017, according to the White House archives.The 51-year-old Minnesota native previously held the position of deputy national security advisor to Obama before he was promoted to chief of staff, according to the archives.Veterans groups are concerned that he will have trouble building trust within the department since he himself is not a veteran, CNN Politics reported. Veterans reportedly hoped Biden would choose an Afghanistan or Iraq veteran.Biden selected Democratic Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to lead the Labor Department on Thursday, Politico reported.Biden, who had heavy union backing during the campaign, has a close relationship with Walsh, a former union member and leader, Politico previously reported.Walsh first joined a labor union, Laborers, Local 223, in 1988 and worked his way up to eventually being elected president of the union in 2005, according to The Boston Globe. In 2011, he was selected to lead the Building Trades Council, which represents 35,000 ironworkers, pipefitters, and other laborers.Walsh also earned a reputation for using strong-arm tactics to get his way, The Globe reported. Walsh was reportedly wiretapped as part of a federal investigation into union practices when he led the Building Trades Council, according to Boston Magazine.“Can he raise his voice? Yes. But who can’t?” John J. Moriarty, a contractor who dealt with Walsh on numerous projects, told The Globe. “He would certainly forcefully want you to get to resolution, but I can honestly say I never felt threatened.”Major unions had come out in support of Biden choosing Walsh to lead the Department of Labor, Bloomberg News reported. American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations President Richard Trumka reportedly reached out to union leaders to rally support for Walsh.Boston Mayor Marty Walsh talks to an attendee of a drive-in watch party for the Democratic National Convention hosted by the Massachusetts Democrats at Suffolk Downs on August 19, 2020 in Boston, Massachusetts. (Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Biden selected Democratic Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo to lead the Department of Commerce on Thursday, Politico reported.Raimondo previously worked as a venture capital at a firm supported by Bain Capital and started a venture firm of her own, according to Politico.

Return to normalcy here means Biden’s administration will seek to shore up relations with allies and reassert leadership in international institutions like the United Nations and NATO, organizations Trump had little interest in.But China may not be so fortunate as to expect a return to its pre-Trump economic relationship with the U.S. Although Biden has not been as critical of the CCP as Trump, he has vowed to bring jobs back to the U.S. from overseas and impose consequences for companies that go offshore.Biden also signaled a China-critical foreign policy stance in late December when he requested that the European Union hold off on entering a trade deal with China until he was in office. The E.U. snubbed his request, however, and approved the deal last week.That deal won’t go into effect until 2022, however, meaning the first indicator of Biden’s long-term policy toward China will be how his administration influences the European Parliament’s debate on the deal. There are pro-China and anti-China factions within the E.U. vying over various aspects of the deal, led by Germany and France respectively.'},\n",

One criticism of this group is their failure to enact conservative policy goals while still taking in enormous sums of money from the donor class.Trump will likely remain a kingmaker in conservative politics long after his term ends, as polling data shows Republicans almost unanimously approve of him and most would back him in the 2024 primaries. One effect of the GOP’s transformation in the wake of Trump’s presidency is arguably the emergence of MAGA, Inc.President Donald Trump walks out of the White House on July 19, 2019 (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)MAGA, Inc. refers to the ecosystem of opinion makers in the post-Trump GOP who attempt to use the president’s popularity and populist brand to advance political goals. But much like their Conservative, Inc. counterparts, they are criticized by detractors for failing to secure meaningful victories while still enjoying the fruits of campaign contributions and media space.Kim Klacik was one Republican congressional candidate who attached herself to the Trump brand during her candidacy for Maryland’s 7th Congressional District. The deck was stacked against Klacik from the start, as the district is home to the Baltimore — a major Democratic stronghold — and the seat was once held by the late Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings.Klacik previously ran for the seat during a special election earlier this year but only garnered 27% of the vote, according to WBAL-TV. She once again lost to incumbent Democratic Rep. Kweisi Mfume during the Nov. 3 general election.But her campaign strategy during the 2020 cycle was highly effective even if she was not expected to win. Klacik released a viral campaign ad in August blasting Democratic Baltimore leaders for the city’s high crime rate and high rates of black poverty. A Federal Election Commission filing showed her campaign raised a record $6.4 million in just three months.Klacik’s campaign incorporated issues like border security and defending law enforcement that are widely backed by Trump voters. Her association with the Trump brand may have paid off even without an election win. Donald Trump Jr. once dubbed her the “MAGA Candidate of the Week” and she earned a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention.Proud to endorse @kimKBaltimore for Congress & name her my #MAGA Candidate of the Week!Dems have failed this district for decades now. Kim wants to rebuild Baltimore & will fight in Congress to lower crime & help local small businesses.DONATE! #MD07https://t.co/pd4TGtF02R— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) August 24, 2020Joe Collins was another Republican congressional candidate who ran in a long-shot race against incumbent Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters to represent California’s 43rd Congressional District. (RELATED: California GOP Endorsed A Man Who Said His Bodily Fluids Were Worth $15 Million)Waters has represented the district since 1991 and Collins only garnered 28% of the vote in November’s election according to the California elections board. But Collins held a 10-to-one fundraising advantage over Waters and raised more than $10 million throughout the campaign, according to OpenSecrets. Small-dollar donors giving $200 or less made up 81% of contributions.Collins depicted himself as a pro-Trump candidate running against a polarizing Democrat, and his association to the Trump brand paid off. He was photographed at a Hamptons fundraiser with Donald Trump Jr. and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in August, according to OpenSecrets. Trump also endorsed Collins in October.Maxine Waters has long been considered “the most corrupt person in Congress”. Only habit keeps her there. Vote for Joe E. Collins lll and get this long time CROOK, Maxine Waters, out of office!!! https://t.co/NeJvqV8JXE— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2020A number of GOP candidates ran similar races against Democratic incumbents in 2020. Among them were Errol Weber, who lost to incumbent Democratic California Rep. Karen Bass with only 14% of the vote, and Lacy Johnson, who lost to incumbent Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar with only 26% of the vote.Some of the candidates faced further scrutiny for taking in contributions — particularly from small-dollar donors — to ultimately run in races they were guaranteed to lose. Klacik later said after the election she planned to use leftover campaign funds to investigate unproven claims of voter fraud in her district, according to the Baltimore Sun.But running long-shot races is not entirely ineffective. Candidates like Klacik and Collins represented legitimate grievances about how Democratic rule in places like Maryland and California has led to adverse outcomes for those communities. (RELATED: Kim Klacik Congratulates Opponent, Says ‘Prepare To Be Held Accountable Like Never Before’)Although a Republican candidate will likely not unseat Waters or Bass for the foreseeable future, they do give disaffected Republican voters in those blue districts and states an opportunity to participate in the electoral process.Klacik told the Daily Caller in a November interview she plans to continue challenging Democratic rule in Baltimore.“We have Sinclair broadcasting and other folks across the country that want to start taking on corruption in some of these major inner cities,” she said. “So we will be going around the country and then of course spending a lot of time in Baltimore just to kind of show and expose a lot of the corruption we see on a daily basis.”Among Trump’s notable electoral accomplishments was capturing a greater share of votes from racial minorities, with many of these communities found in American inner cities. Exit polls show that Trump gained four points with blacks, three points with Hispanics and five points with Asians when compared to 2016, according to the Guardian.Some political observers note that a voter realignment is already underway, but it was the authentic expression of Trump’s brand that transformed the GOP and expanded the party’s electorate in 2020. Avoiding the MAGA version of Conservative, Inc. may be crucial in ensuring that the party secures meaningful victories in 2022 and 2024.'},\n",

Weinstein allegedly threatened opponents with legal action through Boies, saying they’d “hear from Boies” if Weinstein didn’t get his way, according to a 2018 New York Magazine report.\\xa0The attorney claimed ignorance when confronted with accusations of sexual assault against Weinstein, but New York Magazine reported he had been helping to cover up his client’s crimes for years. “Boies’ sbehavior was part of a culture of complicity,” said Stanford University legal ethics scholar Deborah Rhode to New York Mag.\\xa0Actress Rose McGowan is suing Boies, Weinstein, Black Cube, and attorney Lisa Bloom for allegedly trying to prevent her from accusing Weinstein of rape.

Her complaint says that Black Cube used a former Israeli military operative to deceive McGowan into revealing information about her book, and that the operative secretly downloaded sections of the book without the knowledge of McGowan.\\xa0“In 2016, Weinstein learned that McGowan planned to expose him as her rapist in Brave, so he and Boies mobilized a ‘team of fixers’ to foil her plan,” McGowan’s complaint reads.\\xa0NEW YORK, NY – APRIL 26: David Boies and Mary Boies and Harvey Weinstein attends the TIME 100 Gala, TIME’S 100 Most Influential People In The World at Frederick P.

Here’s a look back on the biggest Trump moments of 2020.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announces articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)The Democratic Party’s dogged attempt to impeach and remove Trump from office set the tone for 2020. Just as Trump had shed accusations of Russia collusion, new allegations regarding his relations with Ukraine reared their head.While Democrats successfully impeaching Trump in the House may appear to be a loss, his acquittal in the Republican-held Senate was a foregone conclusion. Polling at the time also showed that Trump saw the highest approval rating of his presidency — 49 percent — in the midst of the impeachment trial in the Senate.Television ratings from the impeachment trial also indicate that Americans simply didn’t care enough about the event to watch it. While major networks typically get 11 millions sets of eyeballs in a given day, they saw just 4 million for the Democrats’ opening arguments in the Senate, according to NBC News.(From L) US President Donald Trump, US Vice President Mike Pence and Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro look on during the daily briefing on the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in the Brady Briefing Room at the White House on April 2, 2020, in Washington, DC. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)While the worthiness of Trump’s response to COVID-19 is up for debate, it is undeniable that the pandemic has been a devastating loss for his presidency.Heading into 2020, Trump was riding a roaring economy, the end of the Trump-Russia allegations and an unpopular impeachment attempt. Then the pandemic came and killed more than 300,000 Americans.Polls from October showed that nearly 60 percent of Americans disapproved of trump’s handling of COVID-19 and just 37 percent approved.The negative sentiment came partly thanks to Trump’s own flip-flops on the pandemic, arguing in the earliest days that the disease would just “disappear.”WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 29: Registered Nurse Patricia Cummings administers the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris at the United Medical Center on December 29, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)Trump’s public comments and tweets about the coronavirus pandemic may be unpopular, but his administration’s push for a vaccine has been undeniably successful.Operation Warp Speed (OWS) is the program Trump and his coronavirus task force used to partner the public and private sectors to boost the development and distribution of a vaccine. Vaccines typically take years or even decades to develop, but Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines were developed in less than 11 months.That speed beats even Dr. Anthony Fauci’s prediction of 18 months, and the vaccine has forced even Trump’s greatest critics to admit the success. President-Elect Joe Biden begrudgingly said Trump deserves “some credit” for OWS on December 21.TOPSHOT – Oregon Police wearing anti-riot gear march towards protesters through tear gas smoke during the 100th day and night of protests against racism and police brutality in Portland, Oregon, on September 5, 2020. (ALLISON DINNER/AFP via Getty Images)While Trump sought to capitalize on widespread unrest by planting his campaign on a law-and-order message, polling shows it didn’t move the needle much.While support for Black Lives Matter first surged and then plummeted as the violence went on, Americans generally did not support Trump’s push to deploy federal troops to hot spots of unrest. The move was unpopular even among members of his administration, with then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper publicly breaking with the president.“The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,” Esper said in June.Trump’s feud with Esper is believed to have played a large roll in Trump’s ultimate decision to fire him in November.(L-R)Bahrain Foreign Minister Abdullatif al-Zayani, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, US President Donald Trump, and UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan hold up documents as they participated in the signing of the Abraham Accords where the countries of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates recognize Israel, at the White House in Washington, DC, Sept. 15, 2020. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)Even as the pandemic and widespread social unrest absorbed the attention of most Americans, the Trump administration was quietly achieving something every president in decades has dreamed of: true progress toward peace in the Middle East.The Abraham Accords that Trump and his administration brokered saw Arab Islamic states like the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain open diplomatic relations with the Jewish state of Israel. The administration says it expects several other Arab states to join the accords, including the regional giant Saudi Arabia. (RELATED First Commercial Flight Between Israel And UAE To Take Off Monday)The Trump administration also brokered a peace agreement with the Taliban in February to begin the withdrawal of U.S. troops from both Iraq and Afghanistan, something Americans have overwhelmingly supported for years.While the withdrawal got off to a slow start, the U.S. military is set to reduce total troop presence in the two countries to 2,500 by mid-January.'},\n",

The injunction replaces her previous restraining order that had prevented Muscogee County from requiring the more than 4,000 voters who faced eligibility challenges to cast provisional ballots.Gardner’s decision comes just days before the two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia, which will decide control of the Senate.The eligibility challenges arose based on data from the U.S. Postal Service’s National Change of Address registry, which Democrats have argued is unverified and unreliable. Although Gardner’s order allows the county to require that those voters cast provisional ballots, it prohibits eligibility challenges from being upheld solely based on data from the change of address registry, according to the report.Muscogee County is also required to inform voters when their eligibility has been challenged in order to allow them to provide evidence that they are an eligible voter.Republicans and Muscogee County officials called on Gardner to recuse herself from the case because of her sister’s activism registering voters and campaigning to repeal laws that she believes amount to voter suppression. (RELATED: Stacey Abrams Suggests Republicans Don’t Know How To Win Elections ‘Without Voter Suppression’)“Stacey Abrams sister is the judge… nothing shady at all here,” Donald Trump Jr. said on Twitter Wednesday. “If it were reversed the Democrats would be screaming for recusal etc. but the GOP won’t because they’re weak.”Judge blocks voter purge in 2 Georgia counties!Stacey Abrams sister is the judge… nothing shady at all here.

The lawsuit alleges that Muscogee and Ben Hill counties violated the National Voter Registration Act when they challenged voters’ eligibility, but lawyers for the counties argued that they were not in violation of the act because the voters were allowed to remain on the rolls.'},\n",

The number of recruits increased two-fold from the 4,000 volunteers who have been supervising early voting in the state for the past few weeks, according to Fox.“Georgians deserve total confidence in the fairness and accuracy of our state’s elections, and we’re thankful to the thousands of volunteers who will ensure that these runoffs are safe, secure, and that every legal vote is counted,” Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue said in a joint statement, according to Fox.“Georgia Republicans have already mobilized the most robust ground game and poll watching operation in the state’s history and are fully prepared to make certain that the integrity of next week’s elections will not be cast under a shadow of doubt.”President Donald Trump has alleged — without evidence — that widespread voter fraud occurred in Georgia and several other battleground states during the 2020 presidential election. Trump lambasted Georgia leaders including Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger for refusing to “find the crime” and being “stupid” in a Tuesday tweet.“I love the Great State of Georgia, but the people who run it, from the Governor, @BrianKempGA, to the Secretary of State, are a complete disaster and don’t have a clue, or worse,” Trump wrote. “Nobody can be this stupid. Just allow us to find the crime, and turn the state Republican.” “The consent decree signed by the “Secretary”, with the consent of Kemp, is perhaps even more poorly negotiated than the deal that John Kerry made with Iran. Now it turns out that Brad R’s brother works for China, and they definitely don’t want ‘Trump’.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Jan. 6 won’t be the first time partisan lawmakers alleged that a wide conspiracy should nullify the results of a presidential election.As Americans witnessed in 2017, such challenges also have the effect of weakening American trust in institutions. Two out of three Democrats, for example, believed Russia actually changed vote tallies despite no credible evidence, according to a 2018 poll from YouGov. Similarly, Trump’s crusade has led nearly 80 percent of Republicans to believe the election was stolen.Just this week, Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley set off a flurry of criticism when he announced Wednesday his intent to object to the Electoral College certification Jan. 6. Hawley cited suppression from big-tech platforms as interference in the election along with election laws in Pennsylvania.Hawley’s objection isn’t quite on the same level that we’ve seen from elements of the #stopthesteal movement, namely that somehow George Soros teamed up with Venezuela to rig voting machines (another election anxiety with a long history).Still, the sentiment recalls liberal efforts in January 2017 to cast poorly made Russian memes on Facebook\\xa0and mean emails about Chelsea Clinton as the deciders of 2016’s election, rather than the plurality of Americans who voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton. (RELATED: Podesta: Calling Chelsea ‘Not Smart’ Would Be ‘Understatement’)America saw a situation similar to Hawley’s Pennsylvania contention in 2005, when a group of Democrats objected to counting Ohio’s 20 electoral votes after insisting Ohio’s election was riddled with widespread “irregularities” that favored former President George W. Bush, according to CNN.Joined by Democratic California Sen. Barbara Boxer, objectors, including Ohio Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, said that a report by Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee found “numerous, serious election irregularities” in Ohio that led to “a significant disenfranchisement of voters,” according to CNN.“How can we possibly tell millions of Americans who registered to vote, who came to the polls in record numbers, particularly our young people … to simply get over it and move in,” Tubbs Jones said at a press conference with Boxer, according to the report.In order for a formal objection to be considered, a member of both the House and the Senate must question a state’s electoral votes in writing, according to The New York Times (NYT).As required by the rules, lawmakers were sent back to their chambers for two hours to debate the challenge and vote on it, CNN reported. Ultimately Ohio’s electoral votes were awarded to Bush.Bush’s 2001 highly contested win in the Supreme Court also led to attempts to object to the certification of electoral votes.The 2000 election was overshadowed by conspiracies, including one that then-Governor of Florida Jeb Bush threw the election to his brother.During the 36-day recount period, the governor’s office made 95 phone calls to Bush’s presidential campaign, according to the Des Moines Register. While the governor was said to have recused himself “from any involvement in what happened after Nov.7, he did not recuse himself from his role as a brother,” Bush’s communications director Katie Baur said, according to the report. It’s unclear what his “role as a brother” entailed.There were also questions over whether then-Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris presented a conflict of interest since she was also a co-chair on the Bush campaign, according to the report.WASHINGTON, DC – SEPTEMBER 20: US President George W Bush, with Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert(R-IL) and Robert Byrd(R-WV), addresses a Joint Session of Congress, 20 September 2001 in the House Chamber in the US Capitol in Washington, DC. (WIN MCNAMEE/AFP via Getty Images)A dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus, along with a few other representatives, tried to block the counting of Florida’s electoral votes, arguing black voters had been disenfranchised, according to the NYT. Democratic Illinois Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. said it was a “sad day in America” after no senator signed the objection, which is required in order for a vote on the matter to occur.Democratic Florida Rep. Alcee L. Hastings also attempted to object, saying there was “overwhelming evidence of official misconduct” before then-Vice President Al Gore silenced him from speaking because he lacked support from a senator, according to the report.Hawley’s recent announcement that he would be objecting to the certification of results is the latest attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election by Republicans and has received criticism from both Republicans and Democrats.Former Democratic presidential candidate and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar\\xa0called his objection a “coup attempt” in a tweet.

See you on the 6th! https://t.co/jDkGVi4vDw— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) December 30, 2020Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse called congressional Republicans’ attempt to reverse President-elect Joe Biden’s victory a “dangerous ploy” in a statement posted to Facebook.“All the clever arguments and rhetorical gymnastics in the world won’t change the fact that this January 6th effort is designed to disenfranchise millions of Americans simply because they voted for someone in a different party,” Sasse wrote. “We ought to be better than that.”Republican Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks and a handful of other House Republicans are planning on objecting the electoral votes, meaning a vote on the issue is likely, according to The Hill.Hawley noted that he is “entitled” to object to the certification of votes just as “Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity” following both the 2004 and 2016 elections.“I cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws,” Hawley said in a statement. “And I cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden.”Hawley’s attempt to question an official Biden victory comes just four years after then-Vice President Biden himself was forced to gavel down House Democrats.Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern objected to the certification of Alabama’s votes, arguing “the electors were not lawfully certified, especially given the confirmed and illegal activities engaged by the government of Russia,” according to CNN. Biden gaveled down his objection because he did not have any backing from a senator.Democratic Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal objected to Georgia’s vote certification, with Biden telling her “it is over,” according to the report.Biden interrupted Democratic Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee when she attempted to object to the certification of votes after New York’s tally was read.“I object on the massive voter suppression that included-” she began.Biden interrupted her, saying “the debate is not in order” as the congresswoman lacked the required senator signature, CNN reported.In 11 instances, Biden was forced to make it clear that objections were moot if not backed by a senator as a handful of representatives attempted to block the vote.“There is no debate. There is no debate. There is no debate,” Biden said as he continued to throw down the gavel.The only question remains, like Gore and Biden before him, will Vice President Mike Pence do the same?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2020Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks and Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley have both pledged to object to Biden’s election victory on Jan. 6.“Following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity,” Hawley said in a statement released Wednesday. “They were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.”“I cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws. And I cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden. At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act.”Though Hawley is the only senator to publicly commit to objecting on Jan. 6, any states’ results he and a House member jointly object to must then be debated and voted on by the entire Congress.Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger predicted Wednesday that 100 other GOP members might also object.“I hope I’m wrong,” Kinzinger stated on The Bulwark Podcast. “I’m guessing it could be upwards of 100.”'},\n",

(RELATED: Columnist Joe Concha Rebukes The Media For Dishonest Reporting On Catholic School Kids)WATCH:“They’re obvious there is no effort to even hide the bias,” Bruce began, saying that journalists seemed almost pleased to announce that they would cover a Biden administration differently than they had covered President Donald Trump over the last four years. “They seem to be thrilled to be able to admit that they’re going to give Joe Biden pass and handle the situation differently.”“The good news is, if you yearned for an objective press, Jim Acosta suddenly becomes invisible and irrelevant because he goes from being confrontational to coddling, and that doesn’t get you book deals,” Concha said, noting that Acosta had gotten a book deal during the Trump administration.Concha went on to say that Acosta’s style might not lend itself well to covering the new administration, adding that there would likely be far fewer antagonistic questions shouted after press briefings wrapped and fewer instances where reporters could “play the victim.” (RELATED: ‘Gotta Let Me Finish, Jim, This Isn’t A Cable News Segment’: Kayleigh McEnany Chastises CNN’s Acosta For Interrupting)“I think now at this point, if you’re not going to challenge those in power, then go work for the party you supported.

Former President Barack Obama, who served two terms in office, increased the nation’s debt by roughly $9 trillion over the course of eight years, according to the Examiner.“[Trump’s] tenure has been marked by a total disregard for any concern about mounting debt,” fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, Jim Capretta told the Examiner. “Trump saw that it would be to his political advantage to be very liberal in terms of spending and tax reductions happening simultaneously.”The president’s first-year tax cuts increased the debt by roughly $1.9 trillion over 10 years, and Trump hiked annual spending from $3.85 trillion to $4.6 trillion in 2020 — all of which came before coronavirus-related expenditures, the Examiner reported citing the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

She told reporters that “issuing a regulatory freeze is standard practice for an incoming administration.”Then State Department spokeswoman and incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks at a briefing (Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images)The current administration has accelerated efforts to enact last-minute policy changes during the final weeks of President Donald Trump’s term in office. Recent regulatory changes affect a broad range of policy areas from asylum rules to environmental standards. A number of these moves could be difficult for Biden to immediately overturn or challenge.Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill are also concerned about “midnight regulations” the Trump administration might push through, according to Fox News. A group of Democrats introduced the Midnight Regulations Review Act earlier this month requiring the Government Accountability Office to provide Congress with information on any proposed regulatory changes.According to leaked audio of a Biden meeting with civil rights leaders, the president-elect said he would sign executive orders to “undo every single damn thing” Trump enacted with the same authority. But Biden also said he opposes using executive orders to implement progressive policy items after facing pressure to do so from progressive groups.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)Census Bureau documents released by the House Oversight Committee in early December indicated that the data may not be delivered until late January, possibly giving Biden a path to reverse the Trump administration’s efforts seeking to exclude undocumented immigrants.One document said that the likely reporting date is Jan. 23, after Biden is sworn in, while another details 13 “anomalies” that the agency still needed to address.The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration’s bid to alter the census count in July 2019 after finding that its true rationale for seeking to do so did not match its arguments, but left open the possibility for the administration to present future arguments.The court punted on the issue again earlier in December, rejecting a challenge to block the administration’s effort because its plans remained unclear.Removing unauthorized immigrants from the count could benefits Republicans in the upcoming redistricting process since doing so would likely lead to an undercount in more Democratic areas with higher immigrant populations.\\xa0(RELATED: Republican Success Down-Ballot Could Give Them An Advantage For Redistricting Process)Biden has spoken out against the move, saying that it ignores the Constitution, which does not say that census counts should be limited to U.S. citizens.“Congress must give the experts at the Census the time to make sure everyone gets counted correctly,” Biden said earlier this month.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Gen. Michael Flynn’s guilty plea this past week — is incredibly troubling.”Kahl, who has served as national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president, held open the possibility that the Trump team did not directly collude with Russia, but he asserted that “the evidence is now irrefutable” that Trump, his associates and top Republicans “broadly conspired to give Moscow a pass despite (or perhaps because of) Russia’s attack on our democracy.”The Biden transition team announced on Wednesday that Kahl will serve as undersecretary of defense for policy.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced legislation authorizing direct cash payments of $2,000 Tuesday, but with a catch to which Democrats will likely object.The bill combines $2,000 payments with a repeal of Section 230, a provision that grants social media companies liability protections against content users post on their platforms, and the establishment of a commission to study allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 election.Though Democrats supported President Donald Trump’s push for $2,000 checks, they have opposed his efforts to abolish Section 230 and investigate his allegations of fraud, giving McConnell’s bill little chance of becoming law.McConnell has so far resisted holding a vote on any legislation regarding increased stimulus checks even as senators from both parties increase the pressure to do so. Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday that he would filibuster the Senate’s override of the annual military bill, keeping the chamber in session through the New Year, unless it held a vote on $2,000 checks.His effort was seconded by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who tweeted on Tuesday that “he would not consent to a vote on the bad defense bill… unless the Senate votes on $2k Covid relief for working people.” (RELATED: Sanders, Hawley, Team Up For Increased Relief Checks)Sen. Bernie Sanders walks after speaking on the Senate floor on Capitol Hill on December 29, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)But Democrats criticized McConnell’s altered bill, which is all but certain to fail to garner enough support.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the bill was “a blatant attempt” to sabotage the passage of $2,000 checks, calling it a “cynical gambit” on Tuesday.Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy echoed Schumer, saying that “poison pills” are “just another way of telling the American people that this body doesn’t support $2,000 payments.”Though legislation authorizing $2,000 checks has the support of Trump and passed the House of Representatives in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, multiple Senate Republicans have come out against the measure.Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey said the bill was “not sound economic policy” given its size, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn said that it was a distraction from the amount of relief that Congress already granted.“This is just opportunistic on the part of the House [Democrats],” Cornyn said. “They’ve got an issue and unfortunately it seems to be drowning out all of the other good stuff we’ve done.”Sen. John Cornyn arrives on Capitol Hill on December 20, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)McConnell’s bill appears to address all of Trump’s most recent demands made when signing the $900 coronavirus relief bill on Sunday. Specifically, he called to “start the process for a vote that increases checks to $2,000, repeals Section 230, and starts an investigation into voter fraud.” (RELATED: Trump Vetoes Military Bill Over Section 230 Before Heading To Florida For Christmas)McConnell’s bill does technically start the process, but as of Wednesday he has yet to schedule a vote on his legislation.Despite the majority leader’s bill, Trump has continued to pressure Republican senators to pass legislation authorizing higher checks, tweeting on Tuesday that those who oppose doing so have a “death wish” and that passing higher checks “is the right thing to do.”Several GOP senators have come out in support of the legislation, including Georgia Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. The two are running in dual Senate runoffs on Jan. 5 which will determine control of the chamber and whether Democrats can obtain full control of Congress and the White House.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: President Donald Trump Pardons Four Former Blackwater Contractors Convicted In Killings Of 14 Iraqi Civilians)The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the decision, calling it an “affront to justice.”“Pardoning the Blackwater contractors is an affront to justice and to the victims of the Nisour Square massacre and their families,” Jelena Aparac, chair of the U.N. working group on the use of mercenaries, said in a statement Wednesday.\\xa0The UN says the U.S. is violating its obligations to hold war criminals accountable. Slatten and his co-defendants, who were part of a tactical support team called “Raven 23,” had opened fire in and around Nisour Square on Sept. 16, 2007, killing 10 men, two women, and two boys, and injuring 17 others. The murder charge was for the killing of Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia’y, a 19-year-old aspiring doctor who was among the civilians gunned down.A cartoon against US security firm Blackwater, which was barred from Iraq over a deadly 2007 shooting, is displayed at an exhibition in Karbala, central Iraq, on November 28, 2011.( MOHAMMED SAWAF/AFP via Getty Images)Slatten was the first to fire, without provocation, according to the Justice Department. Slatten’s co-defendants were found guilty in 2014 of voluntary manslaughter, attempted manslaughter, along with other charges. Slatten was sentenced to life in prison, while the other 3 men got 30 years each. The massacre ignited international outcry over the use of private security contractors in war zones.“The Geneva Conventions oblige States to hold war criminals accountable for their crimes, even when they act as private security contractors. These pardons violate US obligations under international law and more broadly undermine humanitarian law and human rights at a global level,” the UN’s statement continues.The Geneva Conventions are a series of treaties that provide protections for civilians, prisoners of war, and soldiers who are incapable of fighting. The conventions also oblige states to hold war criminals accountable, a point that the UN emphasizes includes private security contractors. By giving private security contractors impunity, states could be encouraged to outsource military operations to the private sector, the UN says.“Ensuring accountability for such crimes is fundamental to humanity and to the community of nations,” she said. “Pardons, amnesties, or any other forms of exculpation for war crimes open doors to future abuses when States contract private military and security companies for inherent state functions,” the statement adds.The pardon was supported by multiple Republican congressmen and others who argued that the four men had been excessively punished, and that the investigations into the incident were tainted. The former contractor’s defense attorneys also argued their clients were ambushed by Iraqi insurgents and returned fire. In the announcement of the pardons, the White House pointed to alleged ties between the case’s lead Iraqi investigator, who prosecutors heavily relied on, and insurgent groups.\\xa0'},\n",

Only 28% of Independents and 11% of Democrats believed voter fraud helped Biden win.In the weeks after Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 election, the Trump campaign launched dozens of lawsuits in key battleground states alleging voter fraud and other irregularities.

After spending days in the hospital, Maxie died Saturday.Atlanta District 7 Council member Howard Shook said on Dec. 22 that it was “obvious that the civilian authorities do not control the streets and cannot provide even a token feeling of safety beyond our front doors.”“To the administration, I don’t want to hear the word ‘uptick.’ Stop minimizing our concerns by telling us that ‘crime is up everywhere.’ Spare us from the lie that the steady outflow of our officers isn’t as bad as it is. And please, not another throw-away press conference utterly devoid of game changing action steps,” he continued.Following Maxie’s death, Atlanta Police confirmed to NBC News that there has been a spike in homicides.“As of the end of the week 52 reporting period we are at 154 homicides compared with 99 for the same period of 2019,” Atlanta Police Officer Steve Avery said. “That is an increase of 61%.”Others are also raising concerns about the lack of protection, with city councilman J.P. Matzigkeit pushing for a privately funded security force that would help the Atlanta Police Department patrol the Buckhead area, according to WSBTV.“We have to tackle this. I have said that we are at war with crime, and we need to act like it,” he said, according to the report.Matzigkeit said that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance-Bottoms’ vocal support of looking into ‘defunding the police’ in response to the shooting of Rayshard Brooks was an “unfortunate reaction” that has hurt the community.“I think it was an unfortunate reaction, and it had some serious morale results in the force. It would be great if the city did what I think is the government’s very first primary obligation, and that is to keep people safe.”MILWAUKEE, WI – AUGUST 20: In this screenshot from the DNCC’s livestream of the 2020 Democratic National Convention, Mayor of Atlanta Keisha Lance Bottoms addresses the virtual convention on August 20, 2020. \\xa0(Photo by DNCC via Getty Images)While Atlanta did not ‘defund’ their police department, Lance-Bottoms said in June that it was really a question of “reallocation of resources” and should be addressed, according to 11Alive.“I think that a very simplified message is ‘defund the police,’ but I think the overarching thing is that people want to see a reallocation of resources into community development and alternatives to just criminalizing … behavior, so I think it’s incumbent upon us to help people articulate that frustration.”Following Brooks’ death, Atlanta police officers’ morale was low, with officers calling out sick and refusing to show up to work after the involved officer was charged with felony murder for shooting Brooks after he allegedly tried to hit the officer with a taser.Matzigkeit, Shook and council member Matt Westmoreland announced Monday that they were allocating $125,000 of their municipal funds to The Buckhead Security Plan, which is a private police force in the district, according to NBC News. (RELATED: Murder Surged In New York City During 2020, And Police Suggest Defund The Police Might Have Something To Do With It)“Buckhead has a very robust and organized business community, and they saw the need to expand into the public safety vacuum created by the City,” Shook said, according to the report.The plan was created by the\\xa0Buckhead Coalition which says the program would “enhance public safety in Buckhead.”The plan would use “supplementary security patrol for commercial areas using extra-duty law enforcement officers, and creating a coordinated security patrol of residential areas by engaging the private security units already operating in Buckhead neighborhoods.”Partnering organizations would be responsible for cost analysis, management and funding issues. The plan would also\\xa0include more surveillance cameras and license plate readers, along with a crackdown on “party houses,” and an increase in support for hiring, training and retaining Atlanta Police Department officers.The Atlanta Police Department, members of the Fulton County Commission, community groups and others reportedly support the plan.'},\n",

The long-term control of the U.S. Senate lies in Georgia. Both Georgia senators have endorsed the $2,000 payment that President Trump has proposed and Mitch ought to bring it up for the clean vote.”The former Republican House Speaker suggested that McConnell also bring up repealing Section 230 and an election fraud commission as clean votes also, separated from the direct payments.“Because frankly, if Warnock and Ossoff could be in favor of the $2,000 unit and can attack Mitch McConnell for the next six days, I think it’s very hard at that point to win the race,” he said. “This is very straightforward.

Baker’s decision, made the day before millions celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, should send a message to the lawmakers that this legislation has no place in a humane society,” Lyons said.The Massachusetts legislation has been backed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and other pro-abortion groups.“Although young people are trusted to make decisions about all other pregnancy care, young people in Massachusetts must seek permission from a parent or guardian to have an abortion,” Planned Parenthood’s messaging on the legislation reads. “If they can’t turn to their parents, they must go before a judge. No young person should have to navigate the court system to seek basic reproductive health care.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Bernie Sanders has vowed to filibuster any attempt at an override on the NDAA bill until McConnell allows a vote on the $2,000 COVID-19 direct relief payments. Trump called for the increase from $600 to $2,000 last week, a proposition Democrats have endorsed but many Republicans have not.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to pass the $2,000 increase by unanimous consent during Tuesday session, but McConnell blocked the move.Everyone having objected to everything – via @senatemajldr and @SenSanders – it’s looking like a delay til Friday on an NDAA override vote, and no clear path to any vote to increase the $600 stimulus.— Margaret Talev (@margarettalev) December 29, 2020Trump originally objected to the NDAA because Congress refused to include provisions in the bill that would dismantle Section 230, the law that governs how internet companies moderate third-party content. Trump also objected to provisions in the bill seeking to rename military bases currently named after Confederate figures.'},\n",

Her order for the United States District Court in Georgia’s Middle District requires that Muscogee County restore 4,033 purged voters, and Ben Hill County restore 152.Gardner rejected a motion for recusal from the Muscogee County Board of Elections in the order. Muscogee County argued that the judge should recuse given that her sister Abrams “engaged in various highly-publicized efforts to increase voter registration and turnout.”Abrams’ organization, Fair Fight, filed a similar lawsuit in the United States District Court in Georgia’s Northern District, according to the motion for recusal. Fair Fight was represented by the same attorneys as Majority Forward, the group that sued Muscogee and Ben Hill counties.Democrats have on multiple occasions alleged that Abrams only lost her 2018 race for governor due to voter fraud and suppression. She lost to then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp by over 50,000 votes, despite record turnout. (RELATED: Stacey Abrams Suggests Republicans Don’t Know How To Win Elections ‘Without’ Voter Suppression)Both Muscogee and Ben Hill counties acted on information presented by local political figures when removing the voters. Chairman of the Muscogee County Republican Party Ralph “Alton” Russell initiated the removal based off of information from the National Change of Address Database, WTVM reported. Russell was also an at-large delegate at the 2016 Republican National Convention, according to his Facebook page.City councilman Tommy Roberts of Fitzgerald, Georgia, filed the Ben Hill County request for removal, according to Politico. Roberts also reportedly used National Change of Address information in his filing.The challenge to the removal was led by Democratic elections lawyer Marc Elias, who was previously general counsel to the presidential campaigns of Democratic former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Elias threatened more federal lawsuits on Twitter.Republicans tried to disenfranchise over 300,000 Georgia voters.

(Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)Pompeo accused the Chinese Communist Party of “gross malfeasance” and misleading the rest of the world on the “true situation in Wuhan after the CCP-imposed strict media controls were enforced and a controllable outbreak turned into a deadly global pandemic.” (RELATED: China Sentences Citizen-Journalist For Challenging China’s State COVID-19 Narrative)He claimed that Zhang’s “hasty trial, to which foreign observers were denied access, shows how fearful the CCP is of Chinese citizens who speak the truth.”“The PRC government’s fear of transparency and its ongoing repression of fundamental freedoms are a sign of weakness, not strength, and a threat to all of us,” Pompeo closed. “The United States will always support the right of Chinese citizens to express themselves freely and peacefully.”Zhang was sentenced Monday to four years in prison for allegedly “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” after being arrested in May.China just gave citizen-journalist Zhang Zhan 4 years in prison for piercing Beijing’s coronavirus cover-up.

And it was bought with the blood of martyrs.”The president highlighted Archbishop Becket’s martyrdom in a proclamation issued Monday, describing how knights of King Henry II of England murdered the Catholic saint in his own church after he refused to acknowledge the king as his supreme ruler.“His last words on this earth were these,” the proclamation said, “‘For the name of Jesus and the protection of the Church, I am ready to embrace death.’ Dressed in holy robes, Thomas was cut down where he stood inside the walls of his own church.” (RELATED: Biden’s HHS Pick Once Said Religious Institutions Don’t Merit The Same Freedoms As Individuals)The White House sends out a proclamation for the 850th anniversary of St. Thomas Becket’s martyrdom.

As long as America stands, we will always defend religious liberty.”“A society without religion cannot prosper,” the proclamation added. “A nation without faith cannot endure — because justice, goodness, and peace cannot prevail without the grace of God.”The president’s comments come amidst several high profile\\xa0religious freedom\\xa0disputes that have come to a head during the coronavirus pandemic.Lawmakers across the United States\\xa0have issued orders restricting or prohibiting religious services to slow the spread of the disease. The Department of Justice and Attorney General William Barr have repeatedly fought\\xa0against such restrictions, warning that \\xa0“even in times of emergency,” federal law prohibits religious discrimination.In December, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington had requested an injunction allowing “sufficient time before Christmas Eve to allow the Archdiocese to plan and celebrate Mass with percentage-based limits rather than a 50-person cap.”“Under both the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the District’s arbitrary, unscientific, and discriminatory treatment of religious worship is illegal,” the\\xa0lawsuit said.\\xa0(RELATED: Mental Health Improved For Only One Group During COVID — And Dems Did Everything They Could To Suppress It)Following the lawsuit, Bowser\\xa0modified the city’s attendance limits, removing the 50-person limit for religious gatherings and instead capping places of worship at 25% capacity with a maximum of 250 people.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': \"A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously ruled Monday that Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order that limited capacity at houses of worship discriminated against places of worship and violated the First Amendment.“The Governor’s order is subject to strict scrutiny because it is not neutral on its face and imposes greater restrictions on religious activities than on secular ones,” Judge Michael Park wrote.“The restrictions challenged here specifically and disproportionately burden religious exercise, and thus ‘strike at the very heart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious liberty,'” the court said, quoting a Nov. 25 decision by the Supreme Court that ruled the caps were unconstitutional.Cuomo’s Oct. 6 executive order limited attendance to either 10 people or 25% capacity –whichever was lesser– in ‘red zones’ and limited ‘orange zones’ to 25 people or 33% capacity.NEW YORK, NEW YORK – OCTOBER 15: Protesters rally in Manhattan against the closing of some schools and businesses in Jewish neighborhoods in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs due to a spike in the numbers of Covid-19 cases in these neighborhoods on October 15, 2020 in New York City. \\xa0 (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Park said the plaintiffs–the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, the Orthodox Jewish group Agudath Israel of America and two other synagogues who argued that the restrictions causes “irreparable harm” because other businesses deemed essential were allowed to operate freely– showed that Cuomo’s order impaired their ability to exercise their First Amendment right.“No public interest is served by maintaining an unconstitutional policy when constitutional alternatives are available to achieve the same goal,” he wrote. (RELATED: Supreme Court Rules In Favor Of Colorado Church, Bars State From Restricting Worship)The appeals court sent Agudath Israel’s case to a Brooklyn federal judge to use “strict scrutiny” to determine whether the 25% and 33% limits were constitutional.Lawyer for Agudath Israel Avi Schick said Monday’s ruling “will be felt way beyond the COVID context. It is a clear statement … that government can’t disfavor religious conduct merely because it sees no value in religious practice,” according to Reuters.The Supreme Court ruled in November that Cuomo’s limitations “strike at the very heart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious liberty” and that “even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.” The high court noted that Cuomo’s restrictions on religious communities were “far more restrictive” than other measures adopted and unfairly discriminated against places of worship.\"},\n",

He did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.In 2019, Galligan was sent a three-second Snapchat video of fellow Heritage High School student Mimi Groves saying “I can drive” before uttering a racial slur. When she was 15 years old, Groves had sent the video over Snapchat to a friend right after she got her learners permit, according to the Times.Galligan did not see the video until last year, when he “tucked the video away,” the Times described, “deciding to post it publicly when the time was right.” The young man, who has a black mother and a white father, told the Times that he had frequently complained to administrators at Heritage High School about students using the racial slur, but said his complaints had not gone anywhere.Amid riots and protests over the death of George Floyd, Groves posted on Instagram urging her friends to “protest, donate, sign a petition, rally, do something” for the Black Lives Matter movement, the Times reported.Jimmy Galligan held on to a three-second clip of a White teenage girl saying the N-word while singing along to a rap song for years. He posted the clip publicly when the girl had been admitted to a university in order to ruin her life. https://t.co/UA84HkMYXg pic.twitter.com/J9FJcf6hjK— Billy (@billygerent) December 27, 2020 She was alarmed to see a stranger comment on her post, “You have the audacity to post this, after saying the N-word,” then discovered that Galligan had posted the 2016 video online. He had waited for her to choose a college before doing so, the Times reported.The video quickly circulated across social media platforms, the publication reported, and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, was reportedly barraged with “furious calls” for the institution to revoke its offer to Groves, who had made the university’s champion cheer team.\\xa0\\xa0A post shared by J I M M Y (@jimmygalligxn)Groves was removed from the cheer team within the next two days, the Times reported. The university also pressured her to withdraw from the school, telling the young girl that they had received hundreds of messages from the public about her video, and warning her that she might not be comfortable on campus.One admissions official told Groves and her family, “They’re angry, and they want to see some action,” according to a recording of the call reviewed by the Times. Groves withdrew.“The university received information in June about a video and captioned image and began to review the situation with Ms. Groves and her family,” the university said in a Monday evening statement to the DCNF. “Ms. Groves voluntarily withdrew her acceptance of the university’s offer of admission on June 4, 2020.”“If I never posted that video, nothing would have ever happened,” Galligan told the Times. (RELATED: Another Professor Resigns Following Accusations She Pretended To Be Non-White)“I’m going to remind myself, you started something,” he said with satisfaction, the publication reported. “You taught someone a lesson.”Galligan now attends Vanguard University in California while Groves is enrolled in online community college classes, the Times reported.“I’ve learned how quickly social media can take something they know very little about, twist the truth and potentially ruin somebody’s life,” Groves told the Times.“It honestly disgusts me that those words would come out of my mouth,” Groves said of her video in an earlier interview. “How can you convince somebody that has never met you and the only thing they’ve ever seen of you is that three-second clip?”“At the time, I didn’t understand the severity of the word, or the history and context behind it because I was so young,” she said, noting that though the slur was in “all the songs we listened to, and I’m not using that as an excuse.”Heritage High School did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mimi Groves could not be reached.The incident was one of several wherein teenagers used social media to call out their friends or peers for “racist behavior,” the Times reported.Public figures like Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam have also been called out for past racist behavior, though consequences were far less dramatic in Northam’s case than in Groves’. The Virginia governor initially admitted in February 2019 that he was in a photograph from a 1984 yearbook showing a person dressed as a member of the KKK and a person wearing blackface. He did not specify which person he was.“I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now,”\\xa0he said, according to The Washington Post. “This behavior is not in keeping with who I am today and the values I have fought for throughout my career in the military, in medicine, and in public service. But I want to be clear, I understand how this decision shakes Virginians’ faith in that commitment.”He did not\\xa0resign from office, though many called on him to do so.Photo courtesy of Eastern Virginia Medical School.The Virginia governor again addressed the public about the matter in May 2019 — but that time he said he was not in the photograph. His comments came after officials at the Eastern Virginia Medical School said they could not “conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph.”“I am not in the racist and offensive photo that appears under my name in the 1984 Eastern Virginia Medical School yearbook,” the\\xa0governor said in May 2019, the Washington Post reported.\\xa0(RELATED: Big-Name Democrats Call On Northam To Resign Following Racist Yearbook Photo Controversy)“That being said, I know and understand the events of early February and my response to them have caused hurt for many Virginians and for that, I am sorry. I felt it was important to take accountability for the photo’s presence on my page, but rather than providing clarity, I instead deepened pain and confusion.”Editor’s note: This post has been updated to reflect additional comment from the University of Tennessee.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

A few days later, however, a photo surfaced of Lightfoot standing with a woman who gave her a haircut.Mayor Lightfoot Criticized After Post Shows Her Getting Haircut During Stay-At-Home Order https://t.co/JkluWJXgdN pic.twitter.com/8jyjReRdZQ— CBS Chicago (@cbschicago) April 7, 2020“I’m the public face of this city and you know, I’m a person who [takes] personal hygiene very seriously and I felt like I needed to have a haircut,” Lightfoot said in a statement after the photo surfaced. “So I got a haircut.” (RELATED: These Governors Told Citizens To Stay Home. Then They Broke Their Own COVID Rules)Lightfoot was also criticized after she posted a video Nov. 7 that showed her celebrating Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election with a large crowd of people gathered closely together. The crowd gathered a few days before Chicago’s stay-at-home advisory went into effect, which said: “Residents should only leave home to attend work, school or to meet essential needs.” Lightfoot told people to “cancel traditional Thanksgiving plans” due to the pandemic just 5 days after the video was posted.Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was caught going to a San Francisco hair salon for a blow-out in August even though indoor salons were closed due to the pandemic. Security footage obtained by Fox News showed Pelosi walking through the salon without wearing a face mask.“I am a single mom, I have two small children, and I have no income,” Erica Kious, the owner of the salon, told Fox News. “The fact that they did this, and she came in, it’s like a slap in the face.”“The speaker always wears a mask and complies with local COVID requirements,” Pelosi’s spokesperson, Drew Hammill, told Fox News.Despite putting in place some of the most restrictive coronavirus measures in the country, California Governor Gavin Newsom was caught dining indoors with a large party Nov. 6. Photos obtained by Fox News LA showed the governor at the French Laundry, a high-end restaurant in California’s Napa Valley. Newsom claimed that the party was outdoors, but the photos show that the sliding glass doors were shut, calling into question the governor’s account.EXCLUSIVE: We’ve obtained photos of Governor Gavin Newsom at the Napa dinner party he’s in hot water over. The photos call into question just how outdoors the dinner was. A witness who took photos tells us his group was so loud, the sliding doors had to be closed. 10pm on @FOXLA pic.twitter.com/gtOVEwa864— Bill Melugin (@BillFOXLA) November 18, 2020Newsom later apologized for attending the dinner party. He said he was uncomfortable once he realized that the group was larger than he expected it to be and called his attendance was a “bad mistake.”“We should have modeled better behavior and not joined the dinner,” Newsom said.A Texas judge plead guilty after violating his own stay-at-home order and will pay a $1,000 fine, his lawyer said. Williamson County Judge Bill Gravell was caught on camera attending a birthday party for his grandson, reportedly wearing fire department protective gear, despite the stay-at-home order that he had enacted in April.Williamson County was in the “red” phase of coronavirus restrictions, which is the most restrictive phase possible.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told citizens to “stay away” from loved ones over Thanksgiving – but said during an interview that he was going to see his 89-year-old mother and two daughters over the holiday. (RELATED: ‘You’re Such A D**k’: New Jersey Gov Confronted Eating Maskless Outside With His Family)“The current plan is my mom is going to come up and two of my girls, [that’s] the current plan,” Cuomo said on the radio station WAMC-FM. “But the plans change, but that’s my plan. But I’m going to work — I have a lot of work to do between now and Thanksgiving.”After facing a massive backlash, a spokesperson for Cuomo said that the governor’s plans had changed and that he was no longer going to see his family.“Given the current circumstances with COVID, [Cuomo] will have to work through Thanksgiving and will not be seeing them,” Richard Azzopardi, a spokesperson for the governor, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.'},\n",

       "  'full_article_text': 'The Daily Caller spoke with New York City restaurant manager Ronan Downs about Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s COVID-19 indoor dining ban, implemented just as winter rolls around in the city.Downs is involved in multiple bars and restaurants located on Stone Street, a historic cobblestone street in the Financial District. The bars and restaurants on Stone Street have had to continue adapting throughout the global pandemic, and Downs said while he understands restrictions must happen, this latest one might be “a little bit overboard.”Downs noted that making money is less important than “keeping people alive,” but told the Caller’s Shelby Talcott that he thinks there is a better way to protect the vulnerable populations while still keeping businesses open. (RELATED:\\xa0NYC’s Oldest Restaurant Survived The American Revolution And A Bombing. Its Owner Says Cuomo’s COVID Restrictions Could Be Its Downfall)“Definitely the rules have changed, no doubt about it,” Downs said. “Having said that, I would think we all know people who’ve been very sick and who have died, and if we had a choice we’d rather look after the elderly and those more susceptible. I don’t think us making money is as important as keeping people alive.”“I do think that right now because of the fact that we check, we take temperatures, we make sure people wear the face masks, we make sure that people are seated and they’re not allowed to walk around the restaurants, we would have control,” he added.WATCH:Downs continued on to discuss an argument that other restaurant owners have made – that their businesses are able to control the safety of those inside more than a household gathering.1.43% of COVID-19 cases are coming from restaurants and bars, according to statewide contact tracing data. Households and social gatherings account for almost 74%, the data indicates.“I think you’re … safer off having the restaurants open at a certain capacity, and I’m thinking around 50% would be a fair capacity for us,” Downs told the Caller.Downs is involved in Route 66, Beckett’s Bar and Grill, The Dubliner and The Cauldron and Stone Street Tavern, he said. Despite the cold weather and the indoor dining ban, he said New Yorkers have continued to come out and try to support small business owners.“It is cold, but New Yorkers are very resilient and I have to say thank you to all those who have come to support us. So many New Yorkers have come out. I see them freezing out here and they’re still having their beer, having their burger, whatever it might be. It’s wonderful,” Downs declared.Ultimately, the local business manager said he would urge politicians to “sit down and “see how difficult it is” for businesses in the city.Check out more from the Daily Caller:Dave Portnoy Rescues Small Businesses While Congress Snoozes‘Stay Open Or Go Live On The Street’: PA Diner Defies COVID-19 RestrictionsEXCLUSIVE: Guillén Family Attorney Discusses Fort Hood Report, Key FindingsSister Of Slain Army Specialist Details Newly-Released Report, Meeting The Alleged Killer'},\n",

Here’s how the special joint session is expected to play out.At 1 p.m. on Jan. 6. the House and Senate will convene together, presided over by Vice President Mike Pence, who is also the president of the Senate, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). He will open the results submitted by each state and pass them to appointed tellers to read aloud.Pence’s role is largely ceremonial and the entire process has historically proceeded quickly. However, several Republican lawmakers have said that they will object to the results of the 2020 election, meaning that certification could take longer.“I will lead an objection to Georgia’s electors on Jan. 6,” tweeted GOP Rep. Jody Hice. “The courts refuse to hear the President’s legal case. We’re going to make sure the people can,” he added, referring to multiple Trump-backed lawsuits that were denied standing by U.S. courts.He was echoed by Georgia Representative-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who tweeted that she “will refuse to certify a fraudulent election” and would also object on Jan. 6.President Donald Trump pumps his fist as he departs on the South Lawn of the White House, on December 12, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Al Drago/Getty Images)However, in order for an objection to be officially considered by Congress, at least one member of the House and Senate must submit one in writing. While it’s unclear if any Republican senators will object, Senator-elect Tommy Tuberville has hinted that he will do so.If at least one member from each chamber objects, then the House and Senate will separately debate for a maximum of two hours, according to the CRS, with members granted five minutes each to make their respective case. After debate, each chamber will vote, with a simple majority needed for the objection to succeed.House Speaker Paul Ryan reacts to Vice President Joseph Biden saying the election is over during an objection on the counting of the electoral votes (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)Any vote, however, is all but certain to fail. Democrats will begin next Congress with a narrow House majority, and Republican senate leadership has cautioned against members of the caucus objecting since it will force them to either vote to uphold Trump’s baseless accusations of fraud or break against the president, which could hurt them politically. (RELATED: GOP Senators Acknowledge Biden’s Win After Electoral College Vote)“It’s just not going anywhere,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune regarding any congressional attempt to overturn the election. “It’s going down like a shot dog.”Congressional objections have happened as recently as 2005, when Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs and Sen. Barbara Boxer objected to Ohio’s results, which showed a narrow win for former President George W. Bush. Both chambers overwhelmingly rejected their objection when they voted.Several Democrats also rose to object to Trump’s win in 2017, but did not ultimately submit objections in writing after being shot down by then-Vice President Biden.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He had suffered from both heart problems and diabetes, which are both conditions that are associated with more serious coronavirus cases, the News noted.Reyes shared a cell with Epstein in August 2019 before he was transferred to Queens Detention Facility, according to the News. The day after Reyes was transferred, Bureau of Prison (BOP) records show, Epstein died of an apparent suicide in a federal jail in New York City in August 2019.The last man to share a cell with Jeffrey Epstein died in a Bronx apartment after catching coronavirus at a jail for cooperating witnesses.Efrain “Stone” Reyes, 51, was found dead at his mother’s apartment, the NYPD confirms.https://t.co/kBDZMo9Chy— New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) December 28, 2020 According to Reyes’s 27-year-old niece Angelique Lopez, her uncle was chosen as Epstein’s cellmate because he was “disabled” and “had a broken leg” and “kept to himself.” Reyes had pleaded guilty to narcotics conspiracy that involved both crack and heroin, the News reported.She continued: “(Epstein) liked to read a lot and he kept to himself. He wasn’t a problem starter or too loud. My uncle said he was a good cellmate.”Epstein was treated badly by both prison inmates and correctional officers, Lopez told the publication.\\xa0(RELATED:\\xa0Bill Clinton Spokesman Says Former President ‘Never’ Went To Jeffrey Epstein’s Pedo Island, Despite Accuser’s Statements)“They knew how much money he had. They said let’s push him around and extort him for money. They thought they could get his money,” Lopez said. “(Staff) were treating him like crap. They were making him sleep on the floor. They wouldn’t let him sleep on a cot.”The FBI questioned Reyes after Epstein’s apparent suicide, Lopez said, noting that her uncle “cooperated” though he was afraid of reprisal.“He was a little worried about if he told on the security workers at MCC they would somehow lash out at him. He was worried if they told them what they did to Epstein he was worried it would follow him and affect him negatively,” Lopez said.“They were asking how Epstein was when he was in the cell, if he seemed suicidal. They were asking if he had any indication that he would do that. My uncle cooperated.”The jail in which Reyes caught COVID-19 had been overrun by the virus early on in the pandemic, the News reported, and Reyes reportedly cried when he told his family that he had caught COVID-19. Reyes was released in April but died five months later, according to the publication.“He thought he wasn’t going to get out of GEO alive,” Lopez said, referring to the private prison where her uncle had been incarcerated. “He thought that was going to be it, he was going to die there.”“I can’t say COVID didn’t play a part (in his death),” Lopez said. “He came back coughing more than normal. His lungs weren’t the same.”The FBI and the SDNY declined to comment for this story. The BOP did not immediately return the DCNF’s requests for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I think a lot of us were relieved he did sign the bill because I don’t think there was a plan if he didn’t, but I don’t think he’s happy about it,” Mulvaney told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”Trump signed the $2.3 trillion coronavirus relief bill Sunday after reprimanding lawmakers for not including more money for individual Americans. Trump stated he wanted the bill to include $2,000 of direct-pay stimulus benefits, rather than the $600 in the bill that he ended up signing.“I think what he was trying to do was simply send a message that he wasn’t really happy with the bill. This is not at all unusual. Keep in mind, the whole bill is $2.3 trillion.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Kevin McCarthy Sends Letter To 23 House Democrats Who Threatened Pelosi If She Didn’t Get Bipartisan COVID Relief Deal)“I think it’s actually a little bit bigger than that. Anytime you have a bill that’s that large, you’re not going to like any particular part of it. People have focused a lot on the Covid relief, and the $600 versus 2,000 but there’s about $1.4-1.5 trillion in other spending in the government funding part of the bill,” Mulvaney continued.Mulvaney stated that the bill itself wasn’t unusual, and that President-elect Joe Biden would face the same problem.“The reason you get these massive bills is that Congress is supposed to break those down into 12 bills during the year, but they’re lazy, and they don’t so they throw it all together at one bill at the end of the year, and essentially challenge any president to either sign it or shut the government down,” Mulvaney said. “Joe Biden is going to face the same difficulties next year. But I think what the president was doing is sort of throwing down a marker for his next political race, possibly and say look, I don’t think this was enough money.”“There’s no reason to absolutely go big right now, you can sort of take this month by month,” Mulvaney concluded.

Then just 23% of Americans thought that he would be remembered as a “failed” president while 18% called him a “great” president and 23% called him a “good” one.Other questions addressed the presidential election — which Trump still has not conceded to President-Elect Joe Biden — and whether or not people believed that the results were legitimate.“By 62%-37%, Americans believe Biden was legitimately elected president.

He admitted to making more than $500,000 in illegal campaign contributions to Democratic campaigns, according to The New York Times.Christie, the former New Jersey governor and Trump confidant, prosecuted the case as U.S. attorney in New Jersey.Kushner admitted to attempting to intimidate William Schulder, his brother-in-law, from cooperating with prosecutors against him in the investigation. Kushner hired a prostitute to seduce Schulder, and videotaped their tryst. Kushner had video of the encounter sent to his sister.Kushner, now 66, served 14 months of a two-year sentence. He was released from prison on Aug. 25, 2006.The White House said Kushner’s philanthropic activity since leaving prison in 2006 “overshadows” his conviction.Christie’s prosecution of Kushner has caused bad blood between him and Jared, who serves as one of Trump’s top White House advisers. Christie, a Republican, addressed the beef with Kushner in his recent book and offered his thoughts on Charles Kushner, a billionaire real estate tycoon.“I just think that it was so obvious he had to be prosecuted,” Christie said in an interview on May 1, 2019, on PBS’s “Firing Line.”“I mean, if a guy hires a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law and videotapes it and then sends the videotape to his sister to attempt to intimidate her from testifying before a grand jury, do I really need any more justification than that?” (RELATED: Chris Christie Says He’s Open To Running Against Trump In 2024)“I mean, it’s one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. Attorney,” said Christie, adding that that district “had some loathsome and disgusting crime going on there.”“But I just laid out the facts. I had a moral and an ethical obligation to bring that prosecution.”WATCH:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdVKV6SPiLwAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I know the GOP. I know Republicans. I know what they’re about at their best, and I will be there for you restoring those virtues.

(Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images)Additionally, the president noted that the NDAA “fails even to make any meaningful changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act” and “includes language that would require the renaming of certain military installations.” He had previously listed both items as redlines and reiterated it in a Statement of Administration Policy sent to Capitol Hill just before the bill’s passage.“Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security and election integrity,” he wrote Wednesday. “It must be repealed.”On renaming bases named after Confederate figures, Trump claimed that those “locations have taken on significance to the American story and those who have helped write it that far transcends their namesakes.”Trump finally noted that the current NDAA “arbitrarily” caps the amount of military construction funds to be used in the event of a national emergency, like coronavirus, and limits his own personal goals of a wide-ranging troop withdrawal from America’s various foreign engagements. Neither item had previously been mentioned as a specific redline by the president nor White House.Congress is expected to override the president’s veto sometime after Christmas recess.

Hanen blocked an Obama administration effort to expand DACA in 2015.“Given … the ongoing federal transition we think this court can expect further changes to that framework soon,” New Jersey State Solicitor Jeremy Feigenbaum, who was representing states seeking to preserve DACA, said, Politico reported. “Policies can be a bit of a moving target during [a] transition.”ICYMI, the hearing in Texas’s lawsuit to end DACA is happening today (in person) in a Houston courtroom https://t.co/yhA3lV5Fme— Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) December 22, 2020 Hanen asked: “How can they change what happened eight years ago?” (RELATED: DHS To Accept New DACA ‘Dreamer’ Applications Under Trump Administration)Feigenbaum argued that the Biden administration could eliminate “confusion” surrounding DACA that followed a Supreme Court ruling denying the Trump administration’s efforts to end the program in 2017, Politico reported.Texas state attorney Todd Disher urged Hanen to rule against DACA and invalidate the program. He suggested giving DACA two years to scale down, a similar plan as the Trump administration’s that failed in the Supreme Court.“There is no additional reason now to delay,” Disher said. “There is simply no reason to leave an unlawful program in place.”Feigenbaum said that the Department of Homeland Security should have the opportunity to craft a new program if Hanen were to\\xa0deem DACA illegal.Hanen said the Biden administration could also reintroduce DACA, but go through a formal period that allows the public to comment on the policy — a step the Obama administration skipped. He said that was one of the flaws with DACA when he ruled against the proposed expansion in 2015.A Justice Department official asked Hanen to allow for an organized shutdown of the program if it’s decided to be illegal, Politico reported.“DHS will need flexibility and time to wind the program down if it is determined to be unlawful,” John Coghlan, the attorney, said.Hanen did not give a timeline for a ruling. He acknowledged that the case at hand is “completely different” from when he ruled against aspects of the program before it was instituted, Politico reported.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Georgia’s Senate runoffs have drawn record spending, record turnout and national attention, setting the stage for two extremely close races on Jan. 5.Republican Sen. David Perdue faces Jon Ossoff, his Democratic challenger, after both finished just under the 50% needed to avoid a runoff in November, while Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Democratic Rev. Raphael Warnock after they earned the most support in a jungle primary featuring over 20 candidates.The two races will determine whether Republicans can hold their slim Senate majority, likely preventing President-elect Joe Biden from passing much of his proposed agenda once he takes office, or whether Democrats can achieve a 50-50 Senate split, giving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote and Biden’s party full control of Congress as a result.Georgia’s runoffs have already seen record turnout since early voting began Dec. 14. Nearly 1.7 million votes have already been cast, according to the U.S. Elections Project, amounting to nearly 20% of the state’s registered voters. Approximately 76,000 Georgians who did not vote in November had registered to vote in January’s election before the state’s Dec. 7 deadline.

(Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)Additionally, while Democrats have been more inclined to vote early or by-mail in almost every election this year, their current share of the early vote is slightly higher than it was in November’s election due to record early turnout among the state’s black voters, according to The Upshot’s Nate Cohn.Though the margin is not far off where it was in November, it could make a difference in a state where Biden won by just 0.24% — the closest margin in the country.Ad spending in both races has also shattered existing records. Over $450 million has been spent on television ads alone since Nov. 3, putting the total spending between both races on pace to hit nearly $600 million by Jan. 5.Both races have also become almost completely nationalized. Democrats have campaigned on the promise that a Democratic Senate — and a unified government — will allow the country to pass sweeping legislation regarding voting rights, clean energy, infrastructure and more, while Republicans have warned that Democratic control of government will put the United States on a path towards socialism.President Donald Trump attends a rally in support of Sen. David Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler on December 05, 2020 in Valdosta, Georgia. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Numerous national political figures have also flocked to Georgia to campaign alongside their respective party’s candidates, including Biden, Harris, President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and former President Barack Obama.While polls have reflected two neck-and-neck races, with some giving the edge to Republicans and some giving the edge to Democrats, forecasters have warned that with races this close in a hotly contested battleground state that turnout is all that matters come runoff day.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He said he will make sure that facilities that temporarily hold migrants are held to high standards.“We must have high standards in our detention centers, and the fact is that our immigrant community has become a source of profit for these private corporations,” League of United Latin American Citizens CEO Sindy Benavides told the DCNF. “Overall, detention centers need to be reviewed to make sure that we have practices in place that are human.”Benavides cited reports of the lack of care and uniformity when it comes to illegal immigrants accessing healthcare and medical treatment such as the multiple allegations against a private ICE detention center in Georgia where female detainees were given hysterectomies without their consent. She also said that children in custody at detention centers are frequently given medication that neither they nor their parents consent to. (RELATED: Acting ICE Director: Anyone Responsible For Alleged Forced Hysterectomies ‘Should Be Held Accountable’)However, county jails don’t have the budget to maintain the same high federal detention standards so they won’t contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house detainees because they simply cannot meet the standards, former ICE Director Thomas Homan told the DCNF.Ries claims that\\xa0 private and for-profit immigration detention centers meet much federal higher standards than other facilities.“They make the strange boogeyman out of so-called private or for-profit detention centers, yet what’s ironic is these standards for immigration detention are so high that they exceed the federal bureau of prisons and many of the state and local sheriffs say they won’t contract with ICE because they can’t afford the standards,” Ries told the DCNF. “I think Americans would be floored at how high the standards are and how generous they are.”The Biden administration has not outlined a plan for processing people if a migrant caravan reaches the U.S. border, though experts believe that Biden would re-institute catch and release policies and eliminate Trump’s Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) which requires asylum seekers and refugees to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed.Biden’s pick for domestic policy adviser, Susan Rice, said that the Biden administration would not take immediate action to end MPP due to public health concerns, The Washington Post reported.“In previous years when families entered the U.S. they were released into the community, and I would say most of them did follow up and check-in with the local court as they were mandated, so we know that there are alternative ways that the U.S. government can work with refugees and immigrants,” Benavides told the DCNF.Around 43% of illegal immigrants pending trial failed to appear in court in 2017, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. Among unaccompanied children, 46% disappeared from immigration courts between 2013 and 2017 and 49% failed to appear in court in 2017.“They would return to a policy of catch and release because there are only so many detention beds and when those are exceeded, you’ve got no more beds to detain people in and so they release them into the interior of the country and say ‘show up for court,’ which many of them never do,” Ries told the DCNF.Recently a migrant caravan from Central America attempted to head to the U.S. after hurricanes and economic downturn though they were stopped at the Guatemalan border and not allowed to continue through the country. The migrants, mostly young people and a few mothers with children, say that they “lost everything” and have “no choice” but to go to the U.S., Reuters reported.“What we’re seeing is that a lot of these individuals that are migrating from some of the countries that were just hit by natural disasters are being turned away or held at the Guatemalan border, so they’re not even able to reach the U.S. border to file for humanitarian relief or asylum,” Benavides told the DCNF. “So many of them aren’t even able to reach the U.S. border to do that.”Rice said that the incoming administration will “need time” to overturn Trump’s immigration policies and expressed concern that if policies are lifted too quickly the U.S. could experience a migration surge, The Post reported.“Migrants and asylum seekers absolutely should not believe those in the region peddling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on Day 1. It will not,” Rice said, The Post reported.“Our priority is to reopen asylum processing at the border consistent with the capacity to do so safely and to protect public health, especially in the context of COVID-19. This effort will begin immediately, but it will take months to develop the capacity that we will need to reopen fully,” Rice said.It’s making and breaking promises like this that keep voters home on Election Day. Why do we continue to do this? We are better than this! We should ALL be pushing Joe Biden to support the immigration measures he promised in January.— Brianna Westbrook (@BWestbrookAZ8) December 22, 2020 The Biden campaign said Trump’s decision to temporarily end DACA disrupted the lives of “millions” of recipients and dreamers, according to his campaign website. The Biden campaign said that dreamers and their parents should have a pathway to citizenship and that he will reinstate the program.“LULAC is pushing for there to be action on day one,” Benavides told the DCNF. She said that LULAC expects a Biden administration to reinstate DACA and Temporary Protected Status within the first 100 days.Benavides added that Biden should consider expanding Temporary Protected Status to cover migrants and asylum seekers from Venezuela, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and all of the countries that recently experienced a natural disaster.The Biden campaign said the administration won’t deport veterans or their families and that he will work on reuniting those who have been with their families, according to the campaign website.“We hope to see a freeze of enforcement practices, and a moratorium of worksite raids, to help deported veterans, we want to see a moratorium on deportations of military service members who have served and fought for our country to be able to provide advanced parole for them,” Benavides told the DCNF.“If our veterans are abroad they’re targeted by the criminal elements simply because of the skills that they have learned through our own military … they’re killed on the spot, so their lives are literally on the line,”\\xa0Benavides added.The Biden campaign said it will increase training for agents and independent oversight of ICE and Customs and Border Protection agencies, though his plan does not address potentially defunding ICE as many progressives have advocated for, according to his campaign website.Neither Rice nor Biden’s pick for national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, commented on the incoming administration’s plans for dealing with Trump’s border wall, interior enforcement or several other key policies instituted by the Trump administration, The Post reported.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Gavin Newsom and Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have enforced new lockdown measures for the Christmas season, prohibiting Americans from gathering together to celebrate the holidays and forcing businesses and restaurants to shut their doors during the busiest season of the year.CNN host Jake Tapper asked Dr. Anthony Fauci in mid November if “Christmas is probably not gonna be possible,” a question that angered many social media users. Obama was formerly criticized for waging a supposed “War on Christmas” through exclusion of the word “Christmas” or Christmas symbols — but the idea that lawmakers could cancel Christmas suggested a much more real war on Christmas to conservatives.

Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) November 27, 2020 Fox News host Tucker Carlson has suggested that “power-hungry leaders” are trying to cancel Christmas because it is “bigger than they are.”“This year, of all years,\\xa0Christmas has a deeper resonance, maybe\\xa0closer to its original meaning,” Carlson said in an early December monologue. “In a time of crisis, you inevitably start thinking\\xa0about things you might\\xa0otherwise ignore if you are\\xa0busier and more content, things\\xa0like, what is the purpose of all\\xa0of this?\\xa0What matters most in my life?\\xa0And what happens when it ends?”Carlson insisted that “we take our leaders seriously\\xa0when we are reminded\\xa0that they are just people” and remember that if “they too will pass, all of us will.”“If death is inevitable — and that\\xa0may be the one thing you are not\\xa0allowed to stay in this country,\\xa0but it’s still true — then\\xa0maybe we should pause before we\\xa0destroy the living in the name\\xa0of trying to eliminate it,” he continued. “Politicians understand this\\xa0threat. They’ve figured out that\\xa0Christmas is bigger than they\\xa0are, and therefore, it is a\\xa0threat to them.\\xa0Better cancel it.”WATCH:\\xa0Carlson also aired a clip of Fauci urging Americans to avoid “congregate settings.” (RELATED: Fauci Discourages Americans From Traveling And Gathering Over Christmas)“What Fauci is saying here in English is that you need to avoid going to church,” Carlson said. “You need to avoid your own family.”“You need to spend Christmas alone,” Carlson added.Religious services are fundamental to many Americans’ observation of Christmas: for example, Catholics observe Christmas as a Holy Day of Obligation centered around attending mass at church.Gallup polling released in early December\\xa0found that only those who attended religious services weekly saw a positive change between 2019 and 2020 in how they rated their mental health. No other Demographic group in the Gallup poll saw a percentage increase in rating their mental health as excellent.“Houses of worship and religious services provide so much more than just a weekly meeting place — they are where so many Americans find strength, community, and meaning,” the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty’s Director of Research Caleb Lyman told the DCNF at the time.The Gallup poll results are particularly striking in contrast to Democratic lawmakers’ restrictions on houses of worship. Governors and mayors across the United States\\xa0have issued orders throughout the pandemic that restrict or prohibit religious services, and the Department of Justice has pushed back against such restrictions on multiple occasions. And as Christmas approaches, lawmakers restrictions have sparked anxieties in many Americans that they will be unable to attend church on Christmas Eve or on Christmas day itself.D.C. Archbishop Wilton Gregory filed a lawsuit in early December against D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser accusing the Democrat of “arbitrary” and “discriminatory” restrictions on churches ahead of Christmas.“Under both the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the District’s arbitrary, unscientific, and discriminatory treatment of religious worship is illegal,” the lawsuit said.\\xa0(RELATED: Mental Health Improved For Only One Group During COVID — And Dems Did Everything They Could To Suppress It)“As Christmas fast approaches, the District has imposed arbitrary 50-person caps on Mass attendance—even for masked, socially-distant services, and even when those services are held in churches that can in normal times host over a thousand people,” the lawsuit said.Bowser later backed down and eased restrictions on churches, allowing D.C. churches to be filled to 25% capacity or 250 persons.The United States Supreme Court sided against Newsom’s restrictions on worship services in early December after the court sided with religious organizations\\xa0challenging Cuomo’s coronavirus restrictions the night before Thanksgiving, calling the New York Democrat’s measures “discriminatory” in its injunction for emergency relief.“The Court’s majority made clear that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise clause is not to be carelessly trampled upon but rather vigorously protected,” Judicial Crisis Network’s Carrie Severino told the DCNF in early December.Becket named both Cuomo and Newsom, along with Democratic Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, as runners up for the foundation’s Ebenezer Award\\xa0for “everyday scroogery” which consists of “barring the doors of houses of worship and turning Americans out into the cold innkeeper-style this Christmas and Hanukkah.”Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam lowered the number of people who may gather in Virginia to 10 people or less ahead of Christmas, sparking anxieties that he would also restrict churches and houses of worship. The governor clarified that this order did not apply to churches, but urged those who wish to continue worshipping in person to stay home and practice recommended safety measures.“This year, we need to think about what is truly the most important thing,” Northam said. “Is it the worship or the building?”“For me, God is wherever you are,” Sisolak said. “You don’t have to sit in the church pew for God to hear your prayers.” (RELATED: DC Mayor Backs Down Following Catholic Church Lawsuit, Eases Restrictions On Churches Ahead Of Christmas)Critics\\xa0of Northam’s comments pointed out that in-person attendance at religious services is a fundamental aspect of worship for many religions, particularly Catholicism.Fake Christians truly, deeply don’t understand Christianity. https://t.co/XGkcZPFXMn— Christopher Bedford (@CBedfordDC) December 10, 2020 All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The group has also pledged $10 million and committed to knocking on 1 million doors in Georgia to ensure conservative voter turnout in an election that will determine which political party controls the Senate. McIntosh told the Caller about Club for Growth Action’s multifaceted messaging strategy in order to accomplish its mission that has been complicated by infighting among Republicans surrounding the results of the 2020 presidential election.“The basic message to the folks here is we’ve got to get everybody on the Republican side to get out and vote. When we do, we will win, Georgia will win, and in the process we will save the country because the Senate is going to be the last bulwark against some of the most liberal ideas the Democrats hope for,” McIntosh told the Caller in a phone interview. (RELATED: Georgia Will Reject Democrats’ Socialist Agenda)CUMMING, GA – DECEMBER 20: Georgia Republican Senate candidate David Perdue (R-GA) arrives to a rally attended by former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley on December 20, 2020 in Cumming, Georgia. (Photo by Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)The group’s bus tour made 28 planned stops across the state of Georgia in 10 different designated market areas, according to Club for Growth Action’s website. It hit 22 of the top 30 Republican counties in the state.Some Republicans have been discouraged by the results of the 2020 presidential election, especially in Georgia where President-elect Joe Biden bested President Donald Trump. Biden is the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since former President Bill Clinton in 1992. “To the folks in Georgia that are disappointed Trump lost, or feel the election was stolen because of fraud, our message to them is we need to go out and vote to vindicate Donald Trump,” McIntosh said of the messaging strategy to ardent Trump supporters. Trump supporters can, “show that in a fair election Republicans can win, will win, Georgia, and that it’s a red state,” according to McIntosh.Club for Growth Action has been telling these Trump voters, “the only way they [Democrats] can steal another election is if you don’t vote,” McIntosh said.Club for Growth Action is attempting to reenergize these voters, while convincing other Republican voters less enthusiastic about Trump to turnout as well. “For the folks around Atlanta and suburban Atlanta,” McIntosh said, “mostly the message to them is ‘look how radical the Democrat agenda is.’ Both Ossoff and Warnock will just fall right into line,” McIntosh said, “Ossoff and Warnock they [Democrats] expect will be people who just carry the water, and go right along with their radical agenda.”Both groups of conservative voters should be motivated to vote for Georgia Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue because of “the $4.5 trillion dollar tax increases that Biden would bring in with his agenda,” the proposition of passing a Green New Deal, and higher amounts of regulation, according to McIntosh.Over the course of the 11-day bus tour, McIntosh said the message was resonating among both camps of Republican voters. “There’s been this subtle shift in the sentiment among the Republicans we are talking to. They are getting more and more excited about this race, and realize how important it is, not only for Georgia, but for the whole country,” McIntosh claimed.The 28 stops along the bus tour’s route included stops in Savannah, Augusta, Brunswick, Columbus and Athens.Club for Growth Action was joined by the American Principles Project, Eagle Forum, Senate Conservatives Fund, Freedom Works for America, March for Life Action and Heritage Action for America, among other conservative groups.The bus tour featured appearances from over 20 conservative lawmakers and leaders, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, Republican Texas Rep. Chip Roy, as well as congressional newcomer Republican Georgia Rep-Elect Marjorie Taylor Greene.On Saturday and Sunday appearances in Savannah, Forsyth County and Peachtree City, Cruz drew crowds of several hundred. Cruz has previously committed to backing some of the president’s election lawsuits if they reach the U.S. Supreme Court, but has also spoken out against pro-Trump figures that have suggested Trump supporters should boycott the Jan. 5 runoffs.I don’t know who this clown is, but anyone saying America would be better off w/ Chuck Schumer as Majority Leader—producing huge tax increases, the Green New Deal, massive amnesty & a packed Supreme Court destroying the Bill of Rights—is trying to mislead the people of Georgia. https://t.co/jtEPT2UtzF— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) December 3, 2020“The simplest solution for the Georgia runoff is to win the races by a big enough margin that they can’t steal the election,” Cruz told the Wall Street Journal in an interview.Cruz has been vocal about what he believes is exactly on the ballot in the Georgia runoffs. “If Joe Biden is president, that means Chuck Schumer is majority leader, and if Chuck Schumer is majority leader, there will be zero constraints on the most radical left-wing ideas they’re pursuing,” Cruz said in a Nov. 12 interview on the Glenn Beck Program.Republican Georgia Rep-Elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has previously been criticized for embracing various conspiracy theories and ties to Q-Anon, made several appearances on the Club for Growth Action bus tour. For Greene, the Georgia runoffs are not only to defend Trump’s legacy as president, “but to defend his 2020 election win that was stolen by Joe Biden and the Democrats,” Nick Dyer, Greene’s spokesman, told the Caller in an email. If Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are elected come January, “Democrats will pack the Supreme Court, add new states, eliminate the filibuster, confiscate our guns, legalize abortion up to birth and shove the job killing Green New Deal down our throats,” Dyer added.DALLAS, GA – OCTOBER 15: Georgia Republican House candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene holds a joint press conference with U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) during which Greene endorsed Loeffler on October 15, 2020 in Dallas, Georgia. (Photo by Dustin Chambers/Getty Images)McIntosh agreed with Cruz and Greene’s assessment of the agenda Democrats will pursue if they take control of the Senate. “Warnock is a true radical,” McIntosh said, “I think that type of leadership would totally hurt Georgette in terms of their credibility and would be very dangerous in the United States Senate.”“I think it helps that folks from all over the country are coming in and speaking on the bus tour, but that they’re also coming in and meeting them door-to-door,” McIntosh said about the conservative effort overall. “We’ve got thousands of people knocking on doors here in Georgia telling them just how important this election is and asking them to go out and vote to save our country.”McIntosh said that Democratic turnout efforts are lacking. McIntosh has not seen evidence of a large, Democratic ground game in Georgia, and suggested that Democrat’s mail-in voting efforts are not at the same level it was in the November election.Karl Rove, Republican strategist and Fox News contributor, also argued that mail-in ballot data does not bode well for Democrats in a Dec. 15 interview with Fox News’ Martha MacCallum. “In November, 1,740,795 people requested a mail-in ballot. 1,362,369 — actually exercised it, voted by mail, so today, the requests are half a million less, a third less than they were for the November election, and what you also need to remember is 600,000 of the people on the list for mail-in ballots, 600,000 of that 1.7 million are automatically on the list. They are on the list for a long time. They sign up for permanent mail-in ballots, so they are counted as a request, but we don’t know whether or not they are actually going to vote,” Rove said. (RELATED: Stacey Abrams Thought She Discovered Something Great For Dems In Georgia. Then Karl Rove Found Out)“They are less Democrat, they are less black, and 60% plus of them are 66 years or older, meaning more likely to be Republican voters,” Rove added.However, that does not mean Democrats and progressive organizations are not pulling out all the stops to win the Jan. 5 runoffs. Biden’s victory in the November election should be a “wakeup call” for Republicans in the state, according to McIntosh.“The biggest thing that has happened is the Democrats got organized, and have out organized Republicans” in Georgia, McIntosh said, crediting the rise of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams for the shift.Really American PAC, a progressive group, has been putting up billboards across the state that read, “Perdue/Loeffler Didn’t Deliver For Trump, Don’t Deliver For Them,” in order to suppress Trump-supporter turnout. (RELATED: Here’s How Democrats Think They’re Going To Win The Georgia Runoffs)“That shows they know their message can’t win, and so they’re trying to be deceptive to fool people,” McIntosh said in reaction to hearing about Really American PAC’s billboard campaign. “I don’t think Georgia will be fooled. They’re pretty savvy voters,” McIntosh added.“If Georgia turns blue, Republicans are in big trouble,” McIntosh said of the long-term ramifications of the Jan. 5 election, “the Democrat mantra is if you have power, use it, and if you lose it, regroup for the next election.”'},\n",

(MICHAEL REYNOLDS/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)FBI investigators relied heavily on the Steele dossier in applications for the surveillance warrants.

Former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith\\xa0pleaded guilty on Aug. 19 to altering an email from the CIA in June 2017 regarding ex-Trump aide Carter Page’s relationship with the spy agency.Barr designated Durham as a special counsel on Oct. 19, a maneuver that will likely add political protection to the investigation during the Biden administration.The order appointing Durham to the role authorized him to produce interim reports about the investigation.Durham has had access to classified information since the beginning of his investigation.Trump issued a declassification memo on May 23, 2019, that directed the leaders of various intelligence community agencies to share information with the Justice Department to assist with the Durham probe. John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, said in October that he has provided Durham with around 1,000 pages of documents to the Justice Department in order to assist with the investigation.In his memo last year, Trump authorized Barr “to declassify, downgrade, or direct the declassification or downgrading of information or intelligence that relates to his review.”Barr, who is stepping down as attorney general on Wednesday, has declassified a series of documents related to Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign, as well as the Steele dossier.Barr has said that he had expected Durham to finish investigation this summer, but that it was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany Says She Was Doxxed During The Riots)“I’ll never forget watching Dana Perino give her press briefing, never thinking that I would one day be behind that podium,” McEnany said, adding that becoming press secretary was “never my goal.”“I always wanted to be in politics and media but never really set out for that position. But it all fit together like a woven web because God had a path lined up for me, as he does for each and every person on earth,” McEnany said. “All you have to do is trust him, and follow the path, and pray, and he makes all the dots fit together.

(FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)Though multiple California officials were floated as Harris’s possible successor, Padilla had been widely seen as the frontrunner and had already received a key endorsement from Sen. Dianne Feinstein.“I have given him my support. I did that quite a while ago,” Feinstein said in early December. “And my sense is that he’s going to represent California very well. He’s someone I would be happy to work with, and also bring Hispanic representation to the Senate for the first time.”Padilla also had the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who lobbied Newsom to tap a Latino for the position and has long pushed for greater Latino representation in the Senate. The Caucus’s chair, California Rep. Tony Cárdenas, said in November that the Democratic Party’s message needed to change “overnight” after it underperformed in Latino communities across the country in November’s elections.Though Padilla’s nomination was seen by many as groundbreaking in a state that is nearly 40% Latino, some Democratic factions urged Newsom to instead pick a black woman to succeed Harris. California progressives, already frustrated with Feinstein’s centrist demeanor, specifically pushed for Rep. Barbara Lee or Rep. Karen Bass, who was also vetted as a running mate for President-elect Joe Biden.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Jen Psaki Says Joe Biden Will Not Speak With AG Candidates About Hunter)Barr’s decision, and his explanation for it, hasn’t convinced some Republicans who are still calling for a special counsel to be appointed before President Donald Trump leaves office. Trump was reportedly frustrated by Barr’s call, and could potentially push replacement Jeffrey Rosen to make the appointment once he takes over.\\xa0Senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham are among those who have called for a special counsel, with both citing potential conflicts of interest if Hunter is to be investigated by a Joe Biden-led justice department.\\xa0The conflict of interest argument is the most frequently cited by conservative legal minds who support the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Hunter.\\xa0David Rivkin, a constitutional lawyer with previous experience working in both the White House Counsel’s Office and the Justice Department, explained to Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn why it could be problematic not to appoint a special counsel: “The failure to move forward vigorously with this investigation now would result in immunity for all involved. This would mean that running for President and winning effectively puts that person and his family above the law.”George Washington University law professor and Fox News legal analyst Jonathan Turley came short of outright saying a special counsel should be appointed, but did say in an op-ed that the Russian collusion probe that led to the appointment of Robert Mueller was based on less evidence than current allegations surrounding Hunter Biden. (RELATED: Russian-Linked Hackers Compromised Email Accounts Of Top Treasury Officials)Turley cites the transition between presidential administrations as a threat to the efficacy of the Biden investigations, saying “Prosecutors in the Russia and Hunter Biden investigations may now face the opposite pressure — to move more quickly in the Trump administration’s final two months. The obvious concern is that a Biden administration might scuttle or shut down pending investigations.”Other legal scholars disagree. Conservative legal expert Andy McCarthy penned a piece in National Review in October arguing against a Hunter Biden special counsel, asserting that the role itself is “pernicious” and often leads to a bloated, unfocused investigation. McCarthy also says the conflict of interest argument is irrelevant to the Trump administration appointing a special counsel, since the Trump administration has no conflict of interest stopping itself from investigating Biden.\\xa0Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifies before the House Intelligence Committee about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Conservatives across the board took issue with the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, claiming that it took up too many resources, dragged on too long, and strayed from its original purpose. Some argue that the entire point of the Mueller probe was to politically harm President Trump, their assertion being that a special counsel could essentially be wielded as a political weapon.\\xa0Special counsels are something many on the right oppose in principle, no matter what the circumstances are. The dissent of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia in the 1988 case Morrison v. Olson is often cited as one of the strongest arguments made against special or independent counsels.\\xa0Scalia writes: “Is it unthinkable that the President should have such exclusive power, even when alleged crimes by him or his close associates are at issue? No more so than that Congress should have the exclusive power of legislation, even when what is at issue is its own exemption from the burdens of certain laws.” (RELATED: Pennsylvania Trump Voter Charged With Voter Fraud)McCarthy says there are alternatives to a special counsel that could suffice for this situation. Foremost, he says Joe Biden could announce now that he will not interfere with or fire the prosecutors currently working on the case. He also points out that even if a special counsel is appointed, they could be fired once the Biden administration takes power anyways.\\xa0It remains to be seen what more Biden will say about the case, but with less than a month now until inauguration day, the Trump team still has time to try to take the case out of the President-elect’s hands.\\xa0'},\n",

Goldstein told the Times it is like “shelling impenetrable bases.”“It’s like World War I, when they would sit there in the trenches and they would shell each other for weeks, but then nothing would happen because everyone was in trenches and bunkers,” Goldstein said.But the fate of the Senate could justify the strategy, Goldstein told the Times.“The stakes are so high and the margins are so tight that even a really inefficient strategy makes sense for people who are trying to control the United States Senate,” Goldstein concluded.More than 1.4 million Georgia residents have already cast their ballots, according to voter tracking website Georgia Votes.'},\n",

(RELATED: Here’s The Latest Intel On The Georgia Senate Races)J.B. Poersch, president of the pro-Democratic fundraising group Senate Majority PAC, said he was confident about the two races. “We all have plenty of money to compete,” he told Politico. “At the end of the day, [Republicans] have markets where they have a lot more votes than we do, but we’re being smart about talking to voters directly in Georgia and using our dollars wisely.”But some donors also admitted they were skeptical if Ossoff and Warnock could actually win. The two elections are likely to be decided by razor-thin margins as the candidates in both races are currently polling within one point of each other, according to Five Thirty Eight.Republicans also outperformed expectations in the general election despite Democrats holding a spending advantage in ads. The Economist’s election forecast projected that Democrats would win a majority in the Senate and gain seats in the House — Democrats only flipped two Senate seats and lost virtually every competitive House race. (RELATED: Trump To Campaign Again In Georgia)One lesson some Democratic donors said they learned after the party failed to flip the Senate was that television and radio ad spending does not guarantee electoral success. Donors are instead funding grassroots organizations operating on the ground in Georgia, according to Politico.“There’s a feeling in the donor community that too much was spent on TV and not enough on field operations,” Democratic strategist Ami Copeland said. “We had parity plus last time on TV, and it didn’t work. If donors are shifting their contributions and their support to ground operations, that at least shows a willingness to learn very quickly as to what might work and try something a little different.”Democratic organizations have switched gears to voter registration and mobilization.

Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue face off against Democratic challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in a Jan. 5 runoff to decide who will hold the majority in the Senate.While Republicans repeatedly warn that Democrats could achieve all their policy goals over the next two years by nixing the Senate filibuster, McConnell told Fox News anchor Dana Perino during a Monday appearance on “The Daily Briefing” that Americans actually prefer “moderation.”WATCH:“The Georgia Senate races, however, do determine whether or not the Democrats will control the entire government,” McConnell said. “And what we fear is if they control the entire government, these movements to defund the police and move us in the direction of socialism will have new legs.”The Kentucky senator cited GOP gains in the House and key Senate wins to suggest that Americans weren’t voting for anything close to radical.“I don’t think that’s what the voters voted for on November 3rd,” he added. “I think the fact that House Republicans did better than anyone anticipated, the fact that Senate Republicans did better than all the pundits had indicated, the American people were voting for moderation, not far left. Winning in Georgia guarantees that the new president will be a moderate because he won’t have any choice.” (RELATED: Trump To Campaign For Loeffler, Purdue In Georgia One Day Before Senate Runoff Elections)Republicans must win one of two seats in the runoff to maintain their slim majority.'},\n",

It passed in two sections in the House of Representatives earlier Monday evening; the first, which included four of the 12 appropriations bills, passed 327-85, while the second, which included the relief package and the addition eight bills, passed 359-53.The compromise was announced Sunday, ending months of partisan gridlock just days before Congress departs for the holidays and before crucial financial benefits were set to expire for millions of Americans. The bill\\xa0could be a lifeline for Americans across the country as unemployment numbers and coronavirus cases and deaths rise in states across the country.President Donald Trump has said that he will sign the bill, averting a government shutdown and authorizing direct relief for millions across the country. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that Americans should see their checks arrive beginning next week.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Dec. 20, 2020. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Despite the bill’s passage, many lawmakers were frustrated with the legislation, which was written largely by congressional leaders without the input of many rank-and-file members. Most lawmakers read the 5,593-page bill’s text only hours before voting on it, due to its being written behind closed doors and a malfunctioning computer file that prevented its distribution Monday. (RELATED: Congress Finally Agreed On A Massive Stimulus Package. Here’s What’s In It)“Congress is expected to vote on the second-largest bill in U.S. history *today*… and as of about 1 p.m., most members don’t even have the legislative text of it yet,” tweeted New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “It’s not good enough to hear about what’s in the bill. Members of Congress need to see & read the bills we are expected to vote on.”She was echoed by Michigan Libertarian Rep. Justin Amash, who lamented congressional leadership for the bill’s closed-door creation.“For half a year, congressional leaders refused to put any legislation on the floor to be considered AND scrutinized AND amended,” he tweeted. “Now, they release a 5,593-page bill with no opportunity to read it, let alone amend it. No responsible legislator should vote for such a thing.”Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on December 20, 2020. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)The bill, which provides $600 stimulus checks, $300 weekly unemployment checks for 14 weeks and approximately $280 billion for small businesses, overcame several last-minute objections that threatened to torpedo the progress made in recent days.Republican Sen. Ron Johnson Friday blocked a bipartisan push for $1,200 checks led by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over his concerns about the bill’s size and the country’s $27 trillion national debt. (RELATED: Josh Hawley, Bernie Sanders Team Up In Joint Push For Direct Cash Payments)Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey also led a last-minute GOP effort Friday to rein in the Federal Reserve’s lending powers, but reached a compromise with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer late Saturday ahead of the package’s announcement.The stimulus package, which is the second-largest in American history, also provides $69 billion for states’ coronavirus vaccination, testing, tracing and prevention efforts. The United States has averaged approximately 216,000 new daily coronavirus cases over the past week, and daily deaths have surpassed 3,000 throughout December.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: CDC Panel Recommends Pfizer Vaccine For People Over 16)The three main groups were adults over the age of 65, adults with high risk medical conditions and essential workers outside of the health care fields.

Among the most vulnerable were elderly Americans with compromised immune systems or other underlying health conditions and some healthcare workers.Vote is 13 to 1 to support the recommendation: Phase 1b: persons aged ≥75 years and frontline essential workers Phase 1c: persons aged 65–74 years, persons aged 16–64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and other essential workers— Jen Kates (@jenkatesdc) December 20, 2020The next step was evaluating the logistics and the difficulties with implementing the rollout and determining which groups could be vaccinated quickly and efficiently. Elderly residents of long term care facilities, for example, were both high risk populations and easy to vaccinate quickly because they were a localized population. Rural workers and those who hold multiple jobs — even if those jobs are deemed “essential” — would be more difficult to accommodate.Screenshot/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdfScreenshot/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdfThe final consideration explored the ethics of the vaccine distribution, noting which populations were more likely to face extreme complications or even death if they were not among the first to receive the vaccine.The committee noted that elderly Americans — particularly those who lived in group homes of any kinds — were more susceptible to exposure, complications and death. Essential workers, however, were put into the higher risk category because minorities were “disproportionately represented in many essential industries” and accounted for a large percentage of the population that could not work from home. Giving them access to the vaccine, the committee said, “promotes justice.”Screenshot/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdfThe committee concluded that, ethically speaking, essential workers should receive priority access because it would “promote justice” and “mitigate health inequities.”Screenshot/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdfACIP Chairman Jose R. Romero stated that the intention had not been to distribute the vaccine by race, but instead to deal with a limited supply and incredible demand.He continues: “The statements being made through various outlets undermine the trust and….work of our committee”. He says that ACIP has never focused on targeting a specific racial or ethnic group in its deliberations.— Jen Kates (@jenkatesdc) December 20, 2020But as Business Insider’s Josh Barro noted, the recommendations did not appear to back up that claim.“The essential workers group gets 2 extra points over 65+ group due to its greater racial and ethnic diversity, causing it to score higher on “ethics” and overall, and was then proposed to be placed ahead in line,” he said.But this was in ACIP’s own November slides.

The lawsuit uses Dr. Mark Ghaly’s comments during a Dec. 8 California Department of Public Health broadcast as an example. Prohibiting outdoor dining “really has to do with the goal of trying to keep people at home, not a comment on the relative safety of outdoor dining,” Ghaly said.Newsom even encouraged Californians to do more activities outside in a Dec. 10 tweet.Mental health is physical health.

Bill text has yet to be released pic.twitter.com/hzcOgxBJji— Manu Raju (@mkraju) December 21, 2020 Americans making $75,000 a year or less will receive a $600 stimulus check, and couples making $150,000 a year or less will receive $1,200, plus $600 per child, the summary says.While the $600 is half of that issued after the CARES Act passed in March, the $600 per child is $100 greater than what the CARES Act authorized.Several senators, led by the bipartisan team of Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, had pushed for $1,200 payments. Their effort was ultimately blocked two separate times Friday by Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who cited concerns over the stimulus bill’s size and the national debt.Unemployed workers will receive an extra $300 a week through March 14, and workers who are self-employed or gig workers will receive additional benefits that were set to expire as well, the summary outlines.Its passage could avert a financial crisis of millions of Americans as unemployment numbers rise amid a spike in coronavirus cases and deaths and since the $600 unemployment benefits created through the CARES Act expired in July.Small businesses hammered by the pandemic will receive $284 billion through the Paycheck Protection Program, the summary describes, including $20 billion for businesses in low-income communities and $15 billion for live venues, including museums and theaters, that have been especially hurt.Airlines, citywide mass transit and railways have also seen wide declines in service due to the pandemic. Airlines will receive $15 billion, mass transit systems in cities across the country will receive $14 billion while city bus systems will receive $2 billion and state highways will receive $10 billion, according to the release from House leadership.Additionally, airports will receive $2 billion and Amtrak will receive $1 billion.The provisions could be a critical life line for some of the largest transit systems in the country, including New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority and the D.C. Metro system as well, which said that it would introduce vast service cuts without federal funding.The congressional compromise includes $20 billion the vaccines’ purchase, approximately $9 billion for their distribution and about $22 billion for states’ testing, tracing and prevention efforts, according to the summary.

The program, however, will not expand its eligibility.Farmers and ranchers will also share a $13 billion pot to help mitigate losses imposed by the pandemic, according to a summary released by the House Agriculture Committee.Schools and colleges will receive $82 billion towards reopening classrooms while simultaneously preventing the spread of the virus. The package delivers $54 billion to K-12 schools, $23 billion to colleges and universities, $4 billion to an emergency relief fund and $1 billion for Native American schools.The package also allows for the expansion of Pell Grants by up to 500,000 students and for 1.5 million to receive the grant’s full value, according to a summary released by Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.The massive compromise also includes a 3% raise for U.S. troops, allocates $7 billion for improving broadband access in rural and low-income areas — an effort led by Oregon Sen.

Compared to this point in the general election, however, the Democrats’ lead is slightly smaller.The results of Georgia’s high-stakes election will determine control of the Senate. Senate control is critical for Republicans who seek to have the power to block President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda, and for Democrats who want to ensure Biden’s plans are implemented. The early voting data at this point in the election shows a tight race between both pairs of candidates.About 36,000 people who didn’t vote in November, including those who were too young at the time, have voted early in the runoffs, according to the Washington Post. The new voters included more young voters and voters of color, groups that both tend to vote Democrat.

The 2020 presidential race between incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is still too close to call with outstanding ballots to count. (Photo by Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)More than $400 million has been spent on advertising by campaigns and independent groups, and get-out-the-vote efforts have been increasingly common during the high-stakes election.“There are highly motivated people who want to get in and do this stuff,” Gabriel Sterling, a top official who manages the voter information system in the Georgia Secretary of State’s office, told the Washington Post. Especially with the holidays coming up, “we don’t know if it’ll stay at this level,” Sterling added.Compared to this point in the November election, more people are casting their votes in person than by mail, the Washington Post reported. Data shows that at least 1.3 million mail ballots, including 600,000 absentee ballots sent to voters who requested them automatically for each election this cycle, were requested for the runoff elections.At least 524,000 ballots had been submitted to county election officials as of Saturday morning, which is 25% fewer than at this point in November. However, more people are voting in person – more than 812,000 people voted early in person, a 9% increase from this point in the last election, according to the Washington Post.Georgia’s Senate elections follow Biden’s narrow victory over President Donald Trump in the state. Out of 5 million votes, Biden won by 11,779 – a narrow margin that led to two statewide recounts and lawsuits from the Trump campaign alleging widespread voter fraud. November was the first time that a Democrat had won Georgia since 1992, the Post reported.'},\n",

Biden announced his climate and energy team that will advance an ambitious agenda to address issues of climate change. (Photo by Joshua Roberts/Getty Images)“Working families are struggling through the deepest, most inequitable economic and jobs crisis in modern history,” Biden said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “This is no time to build back the way things were before — this is the moment to build a new American economy that works for all. Today’s appointees have broad viewpoints on how to build a stronger and more inclusive middle class. With their robust experience and qualifications, they will provide the needed voices to guide my administration in overcoming our nation’s unprecedented economic challenges.”“President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris share a bold agenda to build our nation back better than before for working families,” Biden’s White House chief of staff Ron Klain added. “These individuals join an impressive group of White House staff and advisors focused on making sure every American has a fair shot to pursue and achieve the American dream.”Ramamurti’s selection is particularly noteworthy as the majority of Biden’s picks have strayed away from the progressive wing of the party, despite campaign promises to go further than any previous president on fiscal issues, including raising the federal minimum wage and canceling student loan debt.The Wall Street Journal reported Monday morning that Ramamurti has served on the congressional panel in charge of oversight of coronavirus aid since April.This is a developing story and will be updated with new information as it becomes available.\\xa0'},\n",

       "  'full_article_text': 'Congress agreed on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package Sunday, overcoming several last-minute stalemates over the Federal Reserve’s lending powers and direct cash payments, Senate leaders announced.“At long last, we have the bipartisan breakthrough the country has needed,” Senate Majority Leader McConnell said Sunday on the Senate floor. “I hope we can do this as promptly as possible.”A compromise was reached late Saturday between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, who had sought to end the Fed’s emergency lending programs that were created via the CARES Act’s passage in March. Though congressional leaders touted the agreement, it came to be after months of partisan gridlock stemming from disagreements over the bill’s size and scope.Though an agreement was reached, the bill’s text has yet to be released. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on a House conference call that they should expect a Monday vote, and the Senate should vote on the bill shortly after, though McConnell declined to provide a timeline when asked by reporters, Politico reported.The bill includes $600 relief checks for most Americans, Politico reported, providing at least some financial relief as coronavirus cases and deaths climb and weekly unemployment numbers rise again.Congress also hopes to tie a $1.4 trillion bill that funds the government through September 2021 to the relief package after passing two stopgap bills in the past nine days. The House is expected to pass a one-day stopgap bill to fund the government through Monday and then consider a week-long stopgap to give the Senate more time to pass the relief package before they depart for the holidays.\\xa0(RELATED: Congress Passes Two-Day Stopgap Bill, Second Continuing Resolution In A Week)Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) questions Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a hearing. (Sarah Silbiger-Pool/Getty Images)Following the compromise, senators expressed a sense of relief that a deal was reached before the holidays and a possible government shutdown.“The great news is that Congress is not going to be the Grinch,” said Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday. “We’re going to get this package done.”His comments were echoed by Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Congress resolved its biggest dispute Saturday night and that the bill “is going to get done,” adding that he played a central role in dissolving the dispute between Toomey and Senate Democrats.“It should have happened a long time ago… but it’s going to get done before Christmas,” he said.In addition to the $600 relief checks, the bill includes weekly $300 unemployment checks, over $300 billion in relief for small businesses and substantial sums of money for schools, hospitals, and vaccine distribution networks.Two major sticking points that were ultimately omitted from the bill were liability shields for larger businesses and aid for state and local governments. Democrats objected over liability shields while Republicans said that state and local aid amounted to a “Blue State bailout,” leading both to be left out of the final bill.Several senators supported a bipartisan effort led by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley and Vermont Democratic Sen. Bernie Sanders that called for $1,200 relief checks instead of the $600 proposed. Both earlier floated objecting to any funding bill that did not include substantial direct relief. Their push gained the support of President Donald Trump, who early Sunday called on lawmakers to increase the amount of money Americans receive.\\xa0(RELATED: Josh Hawley, Bernie Sanders Team Up In Joint Push For Direct Cash Payments)U.S. Sen.

I can’t talk about the classified part, but you know what’s out there in the press,” McCarthy said.“The one answer that I got out of that briefing was there is no way Eric Swalwell should continue to serve on the intel committee,” He said. (RELATED: Tucker Carlson: ‘Eric Swalwell … Used His Office To Promote Beijing’s Talking Points’ While Sitting On The House Intelligence Committee)“The challenge here is the leaders of both parties are the only people who select to go on the Intel Committee,” McCarthy said, meaning that it will be up to Pelosi to remove Swalwell from the committee if the congressman does not resign himself.The House minority leader from California, who has already called for Swalwell to step down, described the briefing as “very through” and said, “no one that was in that room could walk out and say Eric Swalwell should be on the intel committee. I don’t know — they had a briefing before in 2015 and I don’t know what that briefing was like compared to this one, but it could not have been the same.”U.S. intelligence officials say that Christine Fang, or Fang Fang, an alleged Chinese spy, infiltrated the offices of multiple politicians in the San Francisco area — including Swalwell, Axios reported in December. Swalwell has refused to discuss\\xa0whether his relationship with Fang was purely professional or not.Swalwell said there was no “wrongdoing” committed during his relationship with Fang and insisted the connection was released because of his opposition to President Donald Trump and his support for impeaching him.McCarthy noted how China has been an obvious threat to U.S. national security but said their efforts to compromise American politicians adds a new dimension.“When you see this Christina [Fang], that she went down as low as the mayor, she went down to know Eric Swalwell as the city councilman, helped him to get to Congress, and continued and tried to put interns in his office.” (RELATED: Ric Grenell: Eric Swalwell ‘The Tip Of The Iceberg’ In Chinese Campaign To Compromise American Leaders)Congressman Eric Swalwell (D-CA) talks to reporters outside a secure area as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testifies in a closed-door deposition as part of the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2020Despite a series of legal defeats and no significant legal wins in challenges across several swing states, Trump has so far refused to concede the November election to President-elect Joe Biden, instead continuing to insist the election was “rigged” and rife with widespread fraud.Meanwhile, as Republican Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue campaign against Democratic challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, respectively, Republicans in Georgia have had to walk a fine line between not wanting to cross Trump publicly and also encouraging Georgia voters that their vote matters.Trump last campaigned in the state on December 5, and pulled back on tentative plans to campaign this weekend at least in part because of continued anger at Georgia’s Republican governor and secretary of state, the New York Times reported. (RELATED: ‘If You Don’t Vote, They Win’: Mike Pence Addresses Georgians With ‘Doubts About The Last Election’)With 50 seats to Democrats’ 48, Republicans must win one of two Senate seats in Georgia to maintain their slim majority.

We need a unified national response to climate change. We need to meet the moment with the urgency it demands, as we would with any national emergency.”Each nominee gave a brief address at the event, highlighting their careers and laying out the incoming administration’s priorities for environmental policy. Regan stated the administration would move with “urgency” toward instituting “environmental justice.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Sen.

It is a threat to the people everywhere,” said Gina McCarthy, Biden’s choice for National Climate Adviser. “Defeating this threat is the fight of our lifetimes.”Biden has long said that combatting climate change would be a top priority for his presidency, a message President Donald Trump and Republicans argued could ruin thousands of American energy jobs.Biden also announced in late November that he plans to appoint former presidential candidate John Kerry to be climate czar and add him to the National Security Council. Kerry will pursue climate policy internationally in negotiations with China and other countries.Biden faced harsh criticism following the second presidential debate with Trump after saying he wants the U.S. to transition away from the oil industry.“I would transition from the oil industry, yes,” Biden said when questioned. ““It has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time. I’d stop giving them federal subsidies.”Nearly 10 million Americans work in the oil industry, according to the American Petroleum Institute.'},\n",

This was a very significant effort,” Pompeo said, adding that \\xa0“we’re still unpacking precisely what it is.”The attack used an array of sophisticated tools to tap into dozens of government and private networks, including the Pentagon, the Treasury and U.S. nuclear laboratories. Intelligence agencies told Congress that the attack was likely carried out by the S.V.R., a top Russian intelligence agency that descended from the K.G.B.In a joint statement released Wednesday, the F.B.I., Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that they were “investigating and gathering intelligence in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors.”Tom Bessert, the former homeland security advisor in Trump’s administration, wrote in a New York Times op-ed Wednesday that “the magnitude of this attack is hard to overstate,” and that the true extent of the attack could go unknown for years.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Pressley said “$600 does not even cover one month’s rent” and noted money “is only part of the negotiation.”Pressley said Democrats and progressives have been advocating “direct cash relief and reoccurring payment” in the past eight months. The congresswoman said her party has\\xa0“been fighting for a rent and mortgage cancellation, eviction and foreclosure moratoriums. For work protections.”Pressley criticized Republicans for preventing progress in the last four years and cited numerous examples.“And if they can approve a 740 billion dollars NDAA, I don’t want to hear about a deficit.

Fang became active in politics in the San Francisco area in 2011, and first met Swalwell when he served as a city councilman in Dublin, California.

The committee handles highly classified government secrets and is considered one of the most sensitive committees in Congress.There is no indication that Swalwell did anything illegal. He claims that he cut off contact with Fang after his briefing from the FBI. Republicans have accused Swalwell of hypocrisy because of his prominent role pushing the since-debunked theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.Seventeen House Republicans submitted a letter to Pelosi on Tuesday calling for Swalwell to be removed from the Intelligence panel.Swalwell has not responded to calls for his removal from the committee.

Lawmakers had sought to tie a funding bill to a coronavirus stimulus package but were unable to reach an agreement after multiple objections over different provisions.The bill now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk, where he will need to sign it before midnight to prevent a temporary shutdown.Even with the stopgap bill, however, there’s no guarantee that Congress can reach a wide-ranging compromise before Sunday.Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson objected two separate times to a bipartisan provision\\xa0Friday supported by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders allowing $1,200 cash payments, despite supporting identical legislation in March, saying that he was concerned that the previously agreed upon $900 billion coronavirus package was too big and that it would have too great an impact on the national debt. (RELATED: Josh Hawley, Bernie Sanders Team Up In Joint Push For Direct Cash Payments)“I completely support some kind of program targeted for small business,” Johnson said, “[But] what I fear we’re going to do with this bipartisan package and what the senator from Missouri is talking about is the same thing, is a shotgun approach,” he added.Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) speaks at the start of a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on the government’s response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on March 5, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images)Though Hawley and Sanders had garnered bipartisan support for $1,200 direct cash payments, double the $600 payments currently included in the bill, Senate rules allow for any member to object to or block a bill’s passage.Hawley and Sanders have also floated blocking the passage of any long-term funding or relief bill that does not include direct cash payments, which could further imperil an eventual compromise.“I’m not going to allow a [continuing resolution] to go through until I know what’s actually in the package,” Hawley told reporters, adding that he wanted “assurance” that any bill included direct financial assistance.“It’s better include direct assistance at a substantial level,” he added.Sanders withdrew a similar objection last Friday, allowing for the one-week stopgap bill’s passage, but said then that he would not do so a second time.“This Congress must address the economic emergency facing the American people,” Sanders said during a speech on the Senate floor last Friday. “I am prepared to withdraw my objection at this moment, but I will not be prepared to withdraw an objection next week. We will deal with the financial crisis facing tens of millions of Americans.”Also Friday, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey insisted that the Federal Reserve be prohibited from renewing lending programs towards small businesses that will expire on Dec. 31.Toomey said that the Fed restrictions were “the most important thing to me” in a call with reporters Thursday, telling them that “maintaining the integrity of the role of the Fed, preventing the Fed from being politicized, from being misused, from becoming an allocator of credit and America’s biggest commercial bank, that’s the most important thing.”Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) questions Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a hearing on the “Examination of Loans to Businesses Critical to Maintaining National Security” on Capitol Hill on December 10, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Brian Schatz. “They want to block the FED from helping the economy under Biden. It’s the reason we don’t have a deal.”He was echoed by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who accused the Republicans of hypocrisy and of seeking to weaken President-elect Joe Biden once he takes office.“It’s fascinating how Republicans were fine with this Fed power when Trump was president but now all of the sudden it’s bad. Almost like they want to use the COVID relief package to sabotage Biden’s presidency,” he\\xa0tweeted\\xa0Friday.Asked whether Americans could expect a vote on a wide-reaching relief bill Friday, Senate Majority Whip John Thune said that such would be a “triumph of hope over experience.”“It’d be a best case scenario. Best case scenario of something getting voted on was probably going to be Sunday, but it may be later,” he added.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Brown spent more than twelve years behind bars, including nearly a decade on death row.Brown is eligible for approximately $2 million in compensation under state law, according to ABC News.However, Texas’ Comptroller’s office rejected Brown’s application, arguing the judge who declared Brown innocent didn’t have the jurisdiction to do so, according to the ruling.The state’s high court said the Comptroller exceeded his duty in rejecting Brown’s claim on the basis that the judge who declared Brown innocent didn’t have the authority to do so.” (RELATED: Death Row Inmate Scheduled To Be Executed Days Before Inauguration Infected With Coronavirus)“The Comptroller’s purely ministerial duty to determine eligibility does not include looking behind the verified documents to review the district court’s factual and legal conclusions de novo,” the ruling read.“We direct the Comptroller to … compensate Brown for the time he was wrongfully imprisoned as required by the Tim Cole Act.”Brown’s attorney, Neal Manne, said Brown was excited about the decision, according to ABC.“Now I think (Brown) can finally close this chapter of his life knowing that the very highest court in Texas unanimously agreed he was treated wrongly and that he’s entitled to be compensated for it.”Spokesman for the comptroller’s office Chris Bryan said the agency will comply with the court’s order, according to ABC.“The Comptroller’s office makes determinations in these claims based on the documentation provided. This claim was no exception, and the claim followed a process that ensures the law is executed properly, including Mr. Brown’s right under the law to appeal his claim to the Supreme Court.”Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis said the decision was one of “justice” in a tweet Friday.“The Texas Supreme Court was on the right side of justice today. Make no mistake – these resources will never make up for the years taken from Alfred Dewayne Brown’s life, but they are the very least that the state can do to help him rebuild.The Texas Supreme Court was on the right side of justice today.

This feels like, Trey, this just got a little bit more heated, more important to pay attention to,” Faulkner said. (RELATED: ‘It’s A Yes Or No Question’: Harris Faulkner Challenges Marie Harf To Name One Republican-Led City Experiencing Violence Similar To Portland)“It’s the hardest committee in all of Congress to get on,” Gowdy replied, noting that members of Congress and even the Intelligence Committee are not required to go through background checks and they are frequently privy to classified information. This, he explained, was why the Speaker and the minority leader were so careful to choose the right people.“Kevin is 100% right. There are 230 members of the House. You can’t find one that wasn’t dating a Chinese spy?” Gowdy asked. “Out of all 230, you can’t find a single member on the Democrat side that wasn’t involved in a relationship, which he won’t even tell us what it was, Harris. He won’t say whether he was sleeping with her or not. He says it’s classified. How? How is that classified, Eric? I mean you want people to not find out about it but it’s not classified.”Gowdy went on to claim that Swalwell sat on that committee because he was a “loyal acolyte” to Pelosi and Democratic California Rep. Adam Schiff.“This is the only reason he is on it. Having to work with him, he is eminently replaceable. I can promise you that,” Gowdy continued.Faulkner then asked Gowdy what he would like to hear Swalwell say with regard to the situation.“Eric, how did this happen for four years. Eric, with all candor, when a woman is expressing interest in you chances are great that she is paid to do so. You have to have the self-awareness to ask, ‘Why do I have this new face in my life?’ ‘Why is this person trying to put an intern in my office and why are they trying to help me get elected to Congress?\\'” Gowdy replied, going on to note that Swalwell had been front and center when it came to accusing the president and members of his family of similar transgressions.“You couldn’t turn on the TV without seeing Swalwell in the Russia investigation. Where is he now? He’s criticizing Jared and Donald Trump Jr. For meeting with a Russian lawyer. They weren’t dating one. They were meeting with one. So, just answer some questions, Eric,” Gowdy concluded.'},\n",

Pat Toomey, has sought to formally block the incoming Biden administration and the Fed from relaunching the programs. Democrats instantly condemned the effort, warning that the effort could slow the economic recovery.“We almost have a bipartisan COVID package, but at the last minute Republicans are making a demand that WAS NEVER MENTIONED AS KEY TO THE NEGOTIATIONS,” tweeted Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz. “They want to block the FED from helping the economy under Biden. It’s the reason we don’t have a deal.”He was echoed by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who accused the Republicans of hypocrisy and of seeking to weaken President-elect Joe Biden once he takes office.“It’s fascinating how Republicans were fine with this Fed power when Trump was president but now all of the sudden it’s bad. Almost like they want to use the COVID relief package to sabotage Biden’s presidency,” he tweeted Friday.U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) talks to reporters on Capitol Hill. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)Senators have tried to tie a coronavirus relief package to a government funding bill, but partisan disagreements have threatened to torpedo the agreement that seemed within reach early Friday. Congress passed a one-week stopgap bill a week ago to avert a government shutdown, but Congress fails to pass a government funding bill by midnight Friday, then the U.S. will shutdown.Toomey said that the Fed restrictions were “the most important thing to me” in a call with reporters Thursday. The programs are set to expire on Dec. 31.“Maintaining the integrity of the role of the Fed, preventing the Fed from being politicized, from being misused, from becoming an allocator of credit and America’s biggest commercial bank, that’s the most important thing,” said Toomey, who is retiring in 2022 but is in line to chair the Senate Banking Committee next Congress, assuming Republicans hold their narrow majority.Talks also stalled Friday after Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson objected to including $1,200 direct cash payments as a part of any relief bill. The measure had bipartisan support from Sens. Josh Hawley and Bernie Sanders, and both have threatened to hold up any funding bill if direct financial assistance is omitted. (RELATED: Josh Hawley, Bernie Sanders Team Up In Joint Push For Direct Cash Payments)“I’m not going to allow a [continuing resolution] to go through until I know what’s actually in the package,” Hawley told reporters, adding that he wanted “assurance” that any bill included direct financial assistance.“It’s better include direct assistance at a substantial level,” he added.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The press secretary said she would “never forget” a day when she was at home, shortly after assuming her role in President Donald Trump’s White House, and a policeman showed up at her door.The policeman reportedly told her, “Hey, I need to check in on you, we heard there were some rioters that were targeting your home,” McEnany told Olohan.

How the hell is the purchase of pots and pans fighting the coronavirus?”The county spent $44,320 in federal funds intended to help fight the coronavirus pandemic at a single pizzeria, and another $34,592 at a local bar and grill, Mychajliw wrote in a letter sent Friday to every member of the House and Senate. The comptroller said in his letter that the county’s use of coronavirus funds for such expenditures could amount to fraud.“Our county executive has been fairly liberal, literally and figuratively, with handing out federal money like he’s Santa Claus at Christmas,” Mychajliw told the DCNF. “I don’t think members of Congress intended coronavirus funds to go towards pizza, wings and pork chops. They wanted it to go towards [personal protective equipment], certain businesses and health care workers on the front lines.”Mychajliw also noted that Erie County, which is part of the Buffalo-Niagra Falls metropolitan area, has divvied out $1,052,972 in CARES Act funds for overtime to 56 salaried political appointees as of the beginning of December.Most notably, Erie County Health Commissioner Dr. Gale Burstein has raked in $166,319 in overtime and holiday pay since the beginning of the pandemic on top of her $202,312 base salary, Mychajliw said.Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz is responsible for allocating money from the federal COVID-19 Relief Fund (CRF) towards food and overtime for political appointees, Mychajliw said.“These are Democratic political patronage hires who should never get overtime. Ever,” Mychajliw said. “There’s no justification for it. Especially for political appointees. When you take a political job and you’re salaried, you know regardless of the hours your work that’s what you’re paid.”Poloncarz spokesman Peter Anderson said all of Erie County’s CARES Act spending “compliant in accordance with the Treasury Department’s guidance documents.”“Also, not just overtime but all COVID-related personnel expenses are eligible for CRF Fund usage,” Anderson said. “And as far as food purchases, food is a common emergency purchase, is CRF fund compliant, and most food is purchased to feed people at the quarantine hotel.”A pedestrian clears their car in front of Buffalo City Hall as lake effect snow bands again set up on December 14, 2010, in Buffalo, New York. (John Normile/Getty Images)Mychajliw told the DCNF that every other county in New York has spent a combined $50,000 in overtime for political appointees this year. Even New York City Mayor Bill deBlasio, who Mychajliw said “spends like a drunken sailor,” doesn’t pay his political appointees overtime, Mychajliw said.“If New York City isn’t doing this, why the hell is Buffalo?” Mychajliw said.The comptroller noted that the overtime payments to Erie County’s political appointees could have a massive impact on their public pension, as a New York state public employee’s pension is determined by their three highest year’s salary. (RELATED: Washington, DC, Giving $100 Million To Help Businesses Struggling During Pandemic)“That’s why people are outraged. It’s not just the overtime they’re getting. This is going to cost taxpayers for decades because it could increase the amount of pension payments these employees are getting,” Mychajliw said.Mychajliw told the DCNF that his county risks being audited by the federal government for risks taking funds from its CARES Act bucket to pay for overtime and food.“If the federal government decided to conduct an audit, I’m incredibly concerned they’re going to have to pay some of this money back,” Mychajliw said.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit.”The associate professor encouraged the Center for Disease Control and Prevention committee to integrate its “social vulnerability index,” which uses “census variables to help local officials identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters.” Variables include overcrowded housing, lack of access to vehicles, and poverty.This is ghastly. https://t.co/zU3J9HTgAi pic.twitter.com/co9ca2J1UO— Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) December 18, 2020 Commentary associate editor Noah Rothman highlighted Schmidt’s suggestions in a Friday morning tweet.

(RELATED: Joe Biden Says He Is ‘Confident’ His Son Did Nothing Wrong)Biden, who was interviewed by CBS’s Stephen Colbert, accused his political opponents of “foul play” by seizing on the investigation.“We have great confidence in our son. I am not concerned about any accusations made against him. It’s used to get to me,” Biden said in the interview, which he conducted with his wife Jill Biden at his side.“I think it’s kind of foul play,” said Biden, adding, “look, it is what it is.”“He’s a grown man. He is the smartest man I know. I mean, in a pure intellectual capacity. And as long as he’s good, we’re good.”WATCH:The younger Biden has been involved in numerous controversies in recent years.He was kicked out of the Navy in October 2014 for using cocaine, had an affair with his late brother’s wife, and was sued for paternity by former stripper Lunden Roberts in 2019. Biden was forced to take a DNA test as part of the lawsuit, which confirmed that he fathered a child with Roberts.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Judge Denies Georgia GOP Lawsuit That Sought To Eliminate Voting Drop Boxes In Runoff)“Now I know we’ve all got doubts about the last election,” Pence said. “That is why we’re going to keep right on fighting. But I got to tell you, and I hear some people saying down here in Georgia, you’re frustrated about the last election, just don’t vote.”“My fellow Americans, I can say from my heart, you’ve got to remember, if you don’t vote for him, they win. If you don’t vote, there could be nothing to stop Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi from advancing their radical left agenda, cutting the military, raising taxes, trampling on our values.”And despite concerns that Republican voters are dissuaded to vote in the upcoming race out of spite of the presidential results, it appears Republican enthusiasm is in full swing.“Everyone that I’m around, we’re ready to vote now,” a 57-year-old businesswoman said while awaiting a GOP rally for the candidates, according to the Associated Press (AP).Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group which canvasses GOP-leaning voters, said people don’t seem to be counting this race out, according to the report.“There are people who are discouraged about (Trump) losing Georgia or being behind. But I haven’t talked to people who’ve said, ‘Oh, the heck with this, it’s all rigged anyway.'”Meanwhile some fear that there will be low voter turnout among Democrats.“This election is not a continuation of what happened in November,” Cobb County Democratic Party chairwoman Jacquelyn Bettadapur said Monday, according to CBS. “It’s a complete reset. It’ll have a different character. It’ll have lower turnout, most likely.”“We always see lower turnouts in runoff elections and in special elections,” she added, according to the report. “We are primarily interested in just turning out any Democrat who voted in November. That’s our target audience, expecting that we will have closer to 50% turnout than the 70% turnout we had overall in November.”A recent poll from Emerson College shows both Republican candidates\\xa0narrowly leading their Democratic competitors by three percentage points. However, Ossoff and Warnock appear to lead in urban and suburban areas.“The data revealed there is little crossover support, which suggests one party should win both seats,” Spencer Kimball, Director of Emerson College Polling said.When it comes to the candidates themselves, negative news about Warnock’s past has flooded the election.Warnock once vowed to “dismantle the value system” of the American “empire.”????

We take all precautions possible, follow the best guidance of public health officials and remain committed to transparency and information sharing when positive tests do arise. We will continue to model this behavior at every opportunity.”Richmond, who served as Biden’s campaign co-chair throughout the 2020 election, is expected to serve an outreach role in the White House, including serving as a go between for Biden with Congress and private groups.This is a developing story and will be updated with new information as it becomes available.\\xa0'},\n",

(RELATED: ‘Our Message Is Really, Really Flawed’: Sen. John Tester On Democrats’ Failure To Connect With Voters)Should Hart’s bid to challenge the results be successful, the House could call for a new election to be held, hold the seat empty until an investigation is completed or declare Hart the winner of the seat.However, 7 out of 10 voters in the district said any election disputes should be resolved by Iowa’s courts, according to a poll for American Action Network by Republican polling firm Cygnal. 58% of those polled said that if the House moved to overturn the certified election results and declare Hart the winner, they would view her as illegitimate. A quarter of voters who voted for Hart would also view her as illegitimate, the poll shows.The poll was conducted among 400 likely voters in the district with a 4.9% margin of error.Iowa Republican lawmakers sent a letter Tuesday to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Democratic Committee Chair Zoe Lofgren and Republican Committee Ranking Member Rodney Davis asking them to reject Hart’s appeal, according to KWWL.In the letter sent by Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst and Representatives-Elect Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra, they say that Hart’s appeal under the Federal Contested Elections Act “would create a dangerous precedent and should be rejected.”Congress intervened in the 1984 disputed Indiana 8th congressional election between Democratic Incumbent Rep. Frank McCloskey and Republican nominee Rock McIntyre, according to The New York Times. McCloskey originally was leading McIntyre on election night, but after two state recounts, McIntyre took the lead. McCloskey contested the race and after a four month battle at the House Administration Committee, McCloskey was declared the winner, according to the Los Angeles Times.'},\n",

If confirmed, she would be responsible for leading the department that oversees most of the country’s natural resources and approximately 20% of the land in the United States.Haaland, who was elected in 2018 in one of the largest oil- and natural gas-producing states, has pledged to emphasize the use of renewable energy sources if confirmed to the position, according to The Washington Post.The department’s transformation will likely play a significant role towards Biden’s efforts to combat climate change. He has pledged to halt new oil and gas drilling on public lands and has said that he will rejoin the Paris Climate Accords on the first day of his presidency.“I come from New Mexico. It’s a big oil and gas state. And I care about every single job,” she said in a recent interview. “[But] we don’t want to go back to normal, right? We don’t want to go back to where we were because that economy wasn’t working for a lot of people.”In addition to overseeing over 109 million acres of protected federal lands and 422 national parks, Interior also protects over 1,000 endangered species and manages public water infrastructure in the West, which has sustained agriculture throughout the region and provided water for millions of Americans from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, according to the Post.\\xa0(RELATED: Interior Secretary Tests Positive For COVID-19)Rep.

Cedric Richmond and Marcia Fudge, both of whom plan to join the Biden administration as well.If all three vacate their posts, then Democrats would have 219 seats. A party needs 218 seats to have a majority.Despite the political risk, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday that she would have no problem with Haaland leaving to join the Biden administration, calling her “one of the most respected and one of the best members of Congress I have served with.”“Congresswoman Haaland knows the territory, and if she is the President-elect’s choice for Interior Secretary, then he will have made an excellent choice,” Pelosi said.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Andrew Cuomo and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins are in talks with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie about increasing tax rates to avoid up to $8 billion in cuts to social services and education, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.A state official told the Wall Street Journal that Stewart-Cousins is willing to impose new taxes on New Yorkers who make more than $2 million a year, and another official familiar with the negotiations said that the new taxes could affect citizens who make more than $1 million a year. Currently, personal income of over $1,077,550 is taxed by New York at a rate of 8.82%, and an additional tax is put in place by New York City.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)During the coronavirus pandemic, wealthy citizens began leaving New York City at higher rates, which created a loss of income for the city that could have long-term consequences. A Unacast study found that 3.57 million people left New York City between Jan. 1 and Dec. 7, and 3.5 million people with lower incomes moved into the city. Many of those who left have moved to other parts of New York or to nearby states.The exodus of wealthy people has resulted in around $34 billion in lost income for the city, Reuters reported. New York is heavily dependent on wealthy citizens for tax revenue – 188,000 taxpayers account for around half of the $50 billion that the state collects in income tax each year, according to the Wall Street Journal.Business groups have warned that increasing taxes could result in more wealthy people leaving the state.“There is a real danger that a large number of New York high earners who are working remotely will not come back to the city if their tax rate is going to increase substantially,” Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the business group Partnership for New York City, told the Wall Street Journal. “New York is not as sticky as it was even three years ago.”'},\n",

Although Biden said he does not support the Green New Deal, his plan calls for a “clean energy revolution” to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.When I hear the words climate change, I hear the word “jobs.” Good paying, union jobs that will solve our jobs crisis while addressing our climate crisis. pic.twitter.com/7NRGNXsMI6— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 14, 2020But polling data shows that climate change was not an important issue for voters in 2020 when compared to other issues like the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. The poll found 42% of voters said climate change was “very important” to their vote according to the Pew Research Center, lower than almost all other issues.“Biden does not have a mandate for such an aggressive climate plan,” Taylor told reporters. Experts also said proposals floated by Biden and his transition team would lead to higher energy prices for consumers and households.Treasury Secretary nominee-designate Janet Yellen, for example, has said she supports a carbon tax and could implement such a policy if confirmed to head the Treasury, according to The Washington Post.But a 2015 study by Brookings Institution researchers found that such a plan would raise the price of gasoline by 36 cents per gallon and add an additional 20% cost to consumer utility bills. (RELATED: Montana Gov Bullock’s Climate Council’s Leaked Plan Pushes For Carbon Tax)Biden’s climate plan also aims for an unprecedented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate rising temperatures. But some climate scientists say that may not work — a 2018 study concluded that global temperatures would still rise for centuries even if greenhouse gas emissions reduced to zero.Steam and exhaust rise from the chemical company Oxea (Lukas Schulze/Getty Images)Incoming CO2 Coalition executive director Greg Wrightstone said he agreed with the assessment. “If the United States reduced 100% of all of its emissions today,” he told reporters Thursday, “it would only avert four-hundredths of a degree centigrade by the year 2050 and only one-tenth of a degree by the year 2100.”Biden vowed to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord during the 2020 campaign, according to MarketWatch. The United States officially backed out of the agreement Nov. 4 under President Donald Trump. Biden’s transition website states that he “will not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change — he will go much further than that.”“It’s not going to be as easy as people have assumed,” Competitive Enterprise Institute climate director Myron Ebell told reporters Thursday. (RELATED: Biden To Appoint John Kerry As ‘Climate Czar’ And Add Him To The National Security Council)Former President Barack Obama viewed the Paris Climate Accord as an executive agreement rather than an international treaty, which requires a two-thirds vote of approval in the Senate for ratification. Biden would likely use a similar framework to re-enter the United States into the agreement.One way to stop the Paris Climate Agreement dead in its tracks is for Trump to submit the agreement to the Senate before his term expires Jan. 20, Ebell told reporters. A Republican majority in the Senate could then prevent ratification of the agreement.'},\n",

Ray then said she was harassed by co-workers, some who called her “freak” and one who threatened to “beat [her] ass” if she used a woman’s restroom.NEW YORK, NY – OCTOBER 08: Activists rally in support of LGBTQ rights at New York City Hall on October 8, 2019 in New York City.

Tulsi Gabbard And Markwayne Mullin Introduce Bill That Would Allow Only Biological Females In Women’s Sports)Watson ruled that while birth certificates can be changed to reflect name changes or adoptive parents, the fact that the certificates cannot be changed to reflect gender was discriminatory.“The Court finds that Defendants’ proffered justifications are nothing more than thinly veiled post-hoc rationales to deflect from the discriminatory impact of the Policy,” Watson wrote. “And post hoc rationales do not suffice under either strict or intermediate scrutiny.”Watson wrote in his decision that prior to 2016, changes to gender on a birth certificate were permitted, but the state’s Department of Health changed the policy.Ray called the decision a “victory,” according to an official statement posted by Lambda Legal, a group that was involved in the suit.“This is truly a victory for the LGBT community, in every aspect,” the statement said.Elizabeth Bonham, staff attorney for the ACLU of Ohio, celebrated the changes.“Today’s ruling affirms that the state must recognize the dignity and true identity of every transgender Ohioan. It is incredibly frustrating that our clients faced years of unlawful discrimination, but today we celebrate this victory as an acknowledgment to their commitment to justice” she said according to the statement.Tennessee is now the only state that doesn’t allow gender changes to be made on birth certificates, according to CNN.\"},\n",

       "  'full_article_text': 'The Justice Department declassified a batch of internal FBI messages from Peter Strzok, the former counterintelligence official who oversaw the bureau’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia.The messages, which Senate Republicans released Thursday, provide new insights into the thinking of investigators who worked on Crossfire Hurricane, the code name for the investigation into the Trump campaign.The documents, obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation ahead of their release, show Strzok and his colleagues discussing strategies for how to handle the investigation, as well as how to approach interviews with targets of Crossfire Hurricane.The declassified documents also show that Strzok was provided with real-time updates as FBI agents or undercover sources were meeting with Trump campaign advisers Carter Page and George Papaodpoulos, who were early targets of the investigation.Republican Sens. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley had asked Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray to declassify the documents on Oct. 30, to help with their investigation of Crossfire Hurricane. The Justice Department declassified the records on Dec. 1.Strzok’s messages, which are from the FBI’s Lync system, also contain numerous references to Christopher Steele, the former British spy whose dossier the FBI used to obtain surveillance warrants against Carter Page. (RELATED: Mueller Found No Collusion)One message suggests that Strzok knew early on that Steele was a source for a story published in Yahoo! News alleging that Page had a secret meeting in Moscow with two Kremlin insiders.“Looking at the Yahoo article, I would definitely say at a minimum Steele’s reports should be viewed as intended to influence as well as to inform,” Strzok wrote on Sept. 23, 2016.Peter Strzok’s FBI Lync messages, released by the Senate Homeland Security CommitteeStrzok, who was fired from the FBI in August 2018, was referring to a report from Yahoo! News about Page’s visit to Moscow in July 2016.It would later be revealed that Christopher Steele was a source for the article, and that he had met with a handful of journalists in Washington, D.C. as part of an opposition research campaign commissioned by the DNC and Clinton campaign.While Strzok indicated that he thought Steele was a source for the Yahoo! article, the FBI maintained its relationship with Steele and failed to inform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) that the ex-spy had contact with journalists.The FBI cut ties with Steele, who had been a confidential human source for the bureau since 2013, after he spoke to a journalists for Mother Jones for another dossier-related story on Oct. 31, 2016.The dossier has since come under intense scrutiny, as several of its allegations have been debunked. A Justice Department inspector general’s report released on Dec. 9, 2019, blasted the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane team for failing to disclose key details about Steele and the dossier to the FISC.Strzok’s messages also show that he and others at the FBI had inside information about CNN’s plans to publish a story about then-FBI Director James Comey’s briefing to Trump regarding allegations in the dossier.“Story no longer Sciutto, now Evan Perez. Internal nervousness about nature of allegations,” Strzok wrote to Page on Jan. 9, 2017, referring to two CNN reporters.“Also Carl Bernstein (yes that Carl) called OPA, said he got a ‘dossier’ from McCain.”“Awesome,” Page replied. “Let Carl run it down then.”Peter Strzok’s FBI Lync messages, released by the Senate Homeland Security CommitteeCNN reported on Jan. 10, 2017, that Comey had briefed Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, regarding an allegation in the dossier that the Kremlin had a sexual blackmail tape against Trump.CNN’s report prompted BuzzFeed News to publish the dossier in full.David Kramer, a close associate of McCain’s, testified that he provided a copy of the dossier to multiple reporters in December 2016 and January 2017, including Bernstein and the BuzzFeed reporter who published the salacious document. (RELATED: McCain Associate Had Contact With A Dozen Reporters Regarding Dossier)McCain had provided a copy of the dossier to Comey in a private meeting on Dec. 9, 2016.The messages also provide a glimpse into Strzok’s theories about Papadopoulos’s role in the alleged collusion scheme with Russia. Strzok’s initial suspicions would later be debunked by the special counsel’s investigation, which found no evidence that any Trump associates conspired with the Russian government.The FBI opened Crossfire Hurricane on July 31, 2016, based on a tip from an Australian diplomat regarding Papadopoulos. The diplomat, Alexander Downer, claimed that Papadopoulos had told him during a meeting in London on May 10, 2016 that the Russian government might help the Trump campaign.Strzok wrote that the FBI wanted to find out more about the alleged offer to assist the Trump team. He speculated that Papadopoulos would have information that would implicate Carter Page and Paul Manafort.Strzok did not explain why he thought those two Trump aides would have knowledge about collusion with Russia, but the theory is likely derived from the Steele dossier. In the dossier, former British spy Christopher Steele alleged that Page worked at the direction of Manafort on a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Kremlin.“I think our anticipation is he has visibility into a conversation about the Russian offer of help (and I’d be willing to bet if he talks, he fingers Page or Manafort),” Strzok wrote to Jennifer Boone, a deputy assistant director, the messages show.Strzok wrote to Jonathan Moffa, a supervisory special agent, that he wanted to find out about Papadopoulos’s “demeanor” in the FBI interview.“If he’s willing to work with us against either of them, I’ll reconsider.”Strzok was notified shortly after that Papadopoulos, who was given the code name Crossfire Typhoon, was speaking to the FBI agents.An FBI employee and Strzok then joked that Papadopoulos’s mother, who was with her son when the FBI approached for an interview, urged him not to go to the FBI’s offices for an interview, but that he went anyway.“Ha, that’s funny re Typhoon,” Strzok wrote. “That’s what you get for not listening to mom.”Peter Strzok’s FBI Lync messages, released by the Senate Homeland Security CommitteePapadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, 2017, to making false statements to the FBI during the Jan. 27, 2017 interview. He was never charged with any crimes related specifically to Russia or any conspiracy involving the Trump campaign.Instead, he was charged with making false statements about the timeline of his meetings in 2016 with Joseph Mifsud, a shadowy Maltese professor who Papadopoulos says told him that the Russian government had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.Papadopoulos volunteered the information about Mifsud to the FBI, but the special counsel’s office later charged him with lying about the dates of his meetings.On Jan. 30, 2017, an FBI employee messaged Strzok to say that they had “opened” a case file on Mifsud.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: House Freedom Caucus Sends Letter To Trump, Asking Him To Reopen The Economy)“We write to urge you to veto the end-of-the-year omnibus spending bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is yet again giving us a massive take-it-or-leave-it bill, negotiated behind closed doors, that expands government, spends at record levels well above the 2011 base cap levels, and funds unnecessary or even harmful federal programs, Most of all, this bill continues to pile massive amounts of debt on top of the more than $27.5 trillion we already owe.”WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 12: Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, (L) talks with Representative Andy Biggs, a Republican from Arizona, during a House Judiciary Committee markup of Articles of Impeachment against President Donald Trump at the Longworth House Office Building on December 12, 2019 (Photo by Jonathan Newton-Pool/Getty Images)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The bill allocates approximately $900 billion towards a coronavirus aid package, along with a $1.4 trillion omnibus, totaling the price to an estimated $2.3 trillion, Fox News reported. The GOP lawmakers claim this would raise the national debt to an alarming rate, adding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “fully funds an agenda rejected by the American people.”“It is noteworthy that Speaker Pelosi saw her Democrat majority significantly shink in the 2020 election. Now she is trying to pass a massive spending bill that fully funds an agenda rejected by the American people, without allowing any debate or amendments whatsoever by the full body of the House of Representatives,” the letter continues.“The incoming 117th Congress should address the outstanding spending issues for fiscal year 2021 by passing individual appropriations bills through the normal legislative process, giving all members an opportunity to pa1ticipate in the lawmaking process – and preventing the disenfranchisement of millions of Americans who have no say.”The letter recommends Congress pass “a short-term resolution” to “allow that process to happen” until the new Congress is sworn-in. (RELATED: Sen. Jon Tester On Democrats’ Failure To Connect With Voters)“Mr. President, we thank you for continuing to fight for the American people and our constituents. Our country will be better off if you veto this omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2021. We will strongly support your efforts to demand better from the fiscally irresponsible Congressional leadership,” the letter concludes.'},\n",

The announcement sent Vaxart’s stock price soaring. The New York Times reported that Armistice Capital, which owns a substantial stake in Vaxart, booked a $200 million profit by selling shares of the company following the announcement about Operation Warp Speed. (RELATED: Operation Warp Speed Doubters’ Tweets Come Back To Haunt)According to the Times, the Department of Health and Human Services said that Vaxart’s participation in Warp Speed was limited.Ricchetti’s lobbying disclosure does not mention the ongoing investigation into Vaxart.Vaxart hired the firm Jeffrey J. Kimbell and Associates in August to lobby Congress and the White House on vaccine development issues.The Ricchetti brothers co-founded their firm in 2001, after Steve Ricchetti left the Bill Clinton administration, where he served as deputy chief of staff. In that role, Ricchetti helped Clinton lobby Congress to pass a controversial trade deal with China.Ricchetti Incorporated registered in August to lobby on behalf of Applied Materials, another California-based firm that produces semiconductor materials. Ricchetti disclosed that he plans to lobby the White House and other executive agencies on U.S. trade policy with China.The Ricchetti brothers’ arrangement closely mirrors that of John and Tony Podesta, who co-founded the now-defunct lobbying firm, the Podesta Group.John Podesta served as Clinton’s chief of staff, making him Steve Ricchetti’s boss.The Podesta Group became one of Washington’s top lobbying shops during the Obama administration. John Podesta served as counselor to President Obama, the same role that Steve Ricchetti will serve for Biden.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Iger previously indicated he would accept a position in the Biden administration, although the transition team has cautioned against “premature” reports on selections.\\xa0Whoever is selected for the post will be entering the role amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China related to the coronavirus pandemic, Uighur human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and trade disputes. Disney and other companies in its orbit have faced scrutiny for their treatment of China and especially their reluctance to cast the Chinese government in a negative light.\\xa0SHANGHAI, CHINA – APRIL 08: In this handout photo provided by Disney Parks, Walt Disney Co. president and CEO Robert A. Iger (left) joins Shanghai Party Secretary Yu Zhengsheng (right) on-stage in Shanghai during the official groundbreaking ceremony for the Shanghai Disney Resort in Shanghai, China.

(RELATED: ‘A Regime That Fears Religion’: New Report Details China’s Crackdown On Religion)While filming the movie, Disney shared the script with Chinese authorities to avoid controversy, including over a past Chinese dynasty.\\xa0Disney had previously displeased the Chinese government in 2018, when the movie “Christopher Robin” was denied release in the country over the Winnie the Pooh character, a symbol of the resistance against the Chinese Communinst Party. The character was blocked on social media after it was used to criticize Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\\xa0The Chinese government has censored American films in an effort to prevent global audiences from viewing the Chinese Communist Party as a major threat, according to Axios. The last time Hollywood cast characters as victims of the Chinese government was in 1997 in “Seven Years in Tibet.”Marvel, purchased by Disney in 2009, has also been accused of censoring films for China, and reportedly replaced a Tibetan character from a movie with a Celtic woman in order to avoid drifting into forbidden territory with China: the dispute over Tibetan sovereignty.\\xa0HONG KONG – JULY 19: In this previously unreleased handout photo Bob Iger, president, chief operating officer and chief executive officer-elect of The Walt Disney Company, joins Mickey Mouse in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle July 19, 2005 at the Hong Kong Disneyland Park.

(Photo by David Roark/WDW via Getty Images)Disney’s embrace of the Chinese government was no secret, given the company’s theme park business in the country. The company opened a $5.5 billion entertainment resort in Shanghai, China, in 2016, Variety reported. Iger called Shanghai Disney the company’s “greatest opportunity since buying land in Florida.” Disney partnered with a state-owned company, Shanghai Shendi Group, for the resort.Disney even opened ‘Avenger: Endgame’ in China two days before it rolled out in the U.S.\\xa0Apple has also demonstrated its reluctance to criticize the Chinese government. Eddy Cue, the company’s senior vice president of internet software and services, has reportedly told creators for Apple + streaming service to “avoid portraying China in a poor light.” He has also told partners that the two things that are off limits are “hard-core nudity and China.”Iger has a long-time relationship with Apple, and a close bond with Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. There was also speculation about a merger between Apple and Disney, with rumors that the two would form a tech and entertainment giant. Iger was on Apple’s board of directors for 7 years, resigning in 2020.\\xa0'},\n",

       "  'full_article_text': 'Hunter Biden was repeatedly told by his business partner that he would begin receiving significant payments from a Chinese private equity firm starting in 2019, emails obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show.The business partner, Eric Schwerin, also told Hunter Biden in a December 2018 email that the Chinese private equity firm, BHR Partners, would generate income for him “over the next couple of years.”The revelations conflict with an October 2019 statement issued from Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, that said Biden had not received any return on his investment in BHR, nor had there been any distributions to the firm’s shareholders since he obtained his 10% equity stake two years prior through his company, Skaneateles LLC.The emails, which were located on a copy of Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop, show that he took out a $150,000 capital loan with one of BHR’s Chinese-based partners in July 2017 to help fund his $420,000 investment into the firm that year. When the loan came due in December 2018, Schwerin advised Hunter Biden to extend the loan for another year so he could pay it back with future distributions.“Since BHR will be making distributions in 2019 far exceeding $150,000 it is a no brainer to extend the loan,” Schwerin wrote to Hunter Biden and Mesires in a Dec. 20, 2018, email. “Of course, if we can execute the agreement as proposed 100% of those BHR distributions would go to you.”Schwerin urged Hunter Biden in a follow-up email one week later, on Dec. 27, to extend the loan, noting that BHR will serve as a revenue stream for him “over the next couple of years.”Eric Schwerin email to Hunter Biden Dec. 27, 2018. (screenshot)BHR is co-owned by the Chinese state-controlled Bank of China, business records for the firm show. The firm states on its website it manages the equivalent of $2.1 billion in assets.Schwerin told Hunter Biden in a Nov. 19, 2018, email that BHR was due to have a “significant distribution in 2019” because of its exit from the Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL).A Financial Times examination into Hunter Biden’s foreign business ties in October 2019 found that that BHR nearly doubled its investment in CATL. The Chinese private equity firm sold its position in CATL for the equivalent of $30.1 million in 2018 after having invested the equivalent of $15.3 million in the battery manufacturer in 2015.Eric Schwerin email to Hunter Biden Nov. 19, 2018. (screenshot)An email Schwerin sent to Mesires on March 6, 2019, indicated that Hunter Biden’s loan was extended.“BHR was valued at RMB 60m in November 2016. In today’s dollars that equates to $8.94m. Skaneateles shares would therefore be valued at $894,000,” Schwerin wrote to Mesires in the email that was later forwarded to Hunter Biden.“I am attributing the full value of the shares even though there is a $150,000 loan due to BHR by Skaneateles because there is a high likelihood that there will be a distribution in 2019 that would repay the loan and still provide a distribution to Skaneateles,” Schwerin added. “This is not even taking in consideration future distributions from exits of Henniges, Sinopec, and Face++. All of these investments are likely to be profitable for BHR.”Eric Schwerin March 2019 email to George Mesires (screenshot)Schwerin’s emails to Hunter Biden in late 2018 and early 2019 appear to be part of negotiations between the two to end their business partnership after a falling out.“Whatever G. Fuck him … he forged my signature,” Hunter Biden emailed Mesires on March 6, 2019, after asked to review an exit proposal Schwerin had sent the lawyer earlier that day.Among the areas of contention between Schwerin and Hunter Biden was their joint ownership in Skaneateles, the entity that holds Hunter Biden’s stake in BHR, according to the email.“My concession is that I truly owe him nothing … he owns 25% of Skaneateles in revenue not equity,” Hunter Biden wrote. “Revenue of which he is no longer due after he was fired 2 years ago or longer. So fuck him.”It’s unclear from the emails if BHR made any distributions to Hunter Biden in 2019 or 2020. Mesires did not return multiple requests for comment asking if Hunter Biden has received or expects to receive future payments from BHR. Mesires also didn’t respond when asked if Hunter Biden’s $150,000 loan used to purchase equity in BHR has been paid off.An attorney representing Schwerin did not return requests for comment.Chinese business records accessed Wednesday show that Hunter Biden still holds his 10% stake in BHR through his LLC despite multiple promises from President-elect Joe Biden that no one in his family would engage in business with foreign corporations or governments if he is elected president.Joe Biden changed his stance on his son’s foreign business dealings in December, telling CNN that no one in his family will “be involved in any business, any enterprise, that is conflicted with or appears to be in conflict, with the appropriate distance from, the presidency and government.”Joe Biden’s transition team did not return requests for comment.Hunter Biden revealed last week that he has been notified that federal prosecutors in Delaware are investigating his “tax affairs.” Multiple news outlets have reported that the probe is focused on Hunter Biden’s foreign business activities.

A senior official in President Donald Trump’s administration described the investigation as “too late” and “ridiculous,” given the WHO’s willingness to relay the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) misinformation on the virus in the early days of the pandemic.The team of researchers will arrive in Wuhan well over a year after COVID-19 first emerged in the city in November 2019.

Ben Sasse expressed skepticism that the investigation would uncover anything more than a best-case scenario for the CCP.“I’m going to take a wild guess that they haven’t asked Taiwan to lead the investigation,” Sasse told the Daily Caller on Wednesday. “At the beginning of the year, when the Chinese Communist Party said ‘jump!’ the World Health Organization asked, ‘how high?’ The WHO has a lot of work to do to rebuild trust and they ought to know that a sugar coated China report isn’t going to get the job done.”Sasse has been highly critical of both China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as its extensive human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Jon Tester strongly criticized his party in an interview published Wednesday, explaining that he believes Democrats failed in many areas during the November elections and saying that the party faces long-term problems.Tester spoke with the New York Times in an interview about the current state of the Democratic party as well as the Nov. 3 elections. Throughout the interview, Tester described flaws in his party and what he believes they could do to fix their messaging moving forward.The Times asked Tester about the “Defund the Police” movement and about the countless riots throughout the country during the past year, specifically, if Democrat’s response to the chaos was too weak, to which he responded by saying, “yes. And then what we didn’t do is we didn’t respond to them. We didn’t come out with strong advertisements saying: ‘Rioting, burglary, is not demonstration and it’s not acceptable. And you’d be punished by the full extent of the court if I’m in a position of leadership.’ We didn’t come out with a very strong pushback on that, and certainly wasn’t timely when it was time.”Tester said the idea of defunding the police was dangerous and recommended adding more police officers to the force.“I think the whole idea about defunding police is not just bad messaging, but just insane. And I’ll tell you why. The area where we have the greatest poverty in the state of Montana is Indian Country. And where do we need more police officers than anywhere else? Indian Country. I mean, that’s a fact. Because of poverty, crime is more prevalent. We need more police officers, not less,” the Montana Democrat said.Montana Democrat Senator Jon Tester who his defending his senate seat from Republican Matt Rosendale campaigns with Democrat Kathleen Williams who is running against Republican Greg Gianforte for Montana’s lone house seat on November 2, 2018 in Livingston, Montana. (Photo by William Campbell/Corbis via Getty Images)In the interview, Tester also took a shot at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, saying: “You cannot have Chuck Schumer talking rural issues to rural people; it ain’t gonna sell. And quite frankly, I don’t know that you can have Jon Tester go talk to a bunch of rich people and tell them what they need to be doing.”Tester also said the American people do not dislike the Democratic party, but the Democratic party has done a poor job of telling Americans what they are actually about.“The problem isn’t that the country’s skewed against the Democrats; the problem is that the Democrats have not done a very good job talking about what we believe in,” he said. (RELATED: ‘We Need New Leadership’ — Ocasio-Cortez Blasts Pelosi, Schumer)“If there’s one mistake that is made way, way, way too often by folks in public service, it’s that you walk into a room and who does most of the talking? The senator,” Tester added.The elections and losses for Democrats in Montana were mentioned in the interview, to which Tester said he could not be compared to Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.“What has happened in Montana as far as losing Max Baucus’s seat, and in North Dakota and in South Dakota, I think speaks to the fact that we’re not speaking to rural America. And look, Steve Bullock lost [this year’s Senate race in Montana] for a number of reasons. One was they nationalized it. They totally nationalized his race,” Tester said.“They tried to do it to me, too. What I had that Steve didn’t have was there wasn’t a damn pandemic, and I could go out. And we did, man. We showed people that I was not A.O.C., for Christ’s sake,” he added.

And by the way, I’ve had this conversation with Chuck Schumer [the Senate Democratic leader] several times — that we have to do a better job developing a message so that rural Americans can say, ‘Yeah, those guys, they think like I do.’ Because that’s what Trump has right now,” he said.Many Democrats in the House reportedly voiced their concerns about the future of the party with Speaker of the House Pelosi in a caucus call after the elections, as Democrats did not expand their majority but instead lost several seats. Democratic Virginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger was reportedly the most vocal, mentioning the defund the police movement, causing Pelosi to fire back and say that Democrats have a “mandate.”House Democrats\\xa0lost a number of seats they were hoping to win on election night, a blow to the party’s hopes of expanding their majority, as some were projecting Democrats to pick up as many as 15 seats.

However, Sisolak’s order imposed a 50 person cap on religious services. (RELATED: ‘New California’ And ‘New Nevada’ File Brief In Support Of Texas-Led Lawsuit Seeking To Overturn Election Results)The panel ruled that while curbing the spread of the coronavirus is a state interest, the state could have set a 50% capacity for houses of worship like it did for retail stores, casinos, restaurants and other businesses.The Supreme Court refused to take the case in July, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the majority in rejecting the bid, which gave no reasons and was unsigned.Justice Samuel Alito criticized Sisolak’s order.“The Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion. It says nothing about the freedom to play craps or black-jack, to feed tokens into a slot machine, or to engage in any other game of chance. But the Governor of Nevada apparently has different priorities.”However, the Supreme Court ruled in November that Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s coronavirus restrictions that restricted capacity limits at places of worship were unconstitutional because they were “discriminatory,” against houses of worship.NEW YORK, NEW YORK – NOVEMBER 27: Empty pews are marked for spacing in a Manhattan church on November 27, 2020 in New York City.

Both were issued in March following the passage of the CARES Act, and weekly unemployment benefits expired in July.The national poverty rate rose from 9.3% in June to 11.7% in November, resulting in approximately 7.8 million additional Americans living below the federal poverty line, the study says.The benefits granted through the CARES Act helped lower the federal unemployment rate, the researchers said, but the expiration of federal relief and the overall economic toll imposed by the pandemic forced more Americans into poverty even as the unemployment rate lowered.“The entire decline in poverty through June can be accounted for by the one-time stimulus checks the federal government issued, predominantly in April and May, and the expansion of unemployment insurance eligibility and benefits. In fact, in the absence of these programs, poverty would have risen sharply,” the study’s authors wrote.A view of the line as Food Bank For New York City distributes Thanksgiving meals to go at Food Bank Community Kitchen on November 25, 2020 in New York City.

If lawmakers fail to pass another relief bill approximately 9.4 million Americans stand to lose unemployment insurance, state unemployment benefits and other aid measures established by the CARES Act on Dec. 31, according to a study released by the JP Morgan Chase Research Institute.Millions of Americans could also face eviction without another relief bill since protections issued through the CARES Act expire at the end of the year as well.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Story coming with @zcolman— Tyler Pager (@tylerpager) December 15, 2020Most of the Energy Department’s roughly $35 billion budget goes to maintaining the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal. But the department also operates 17 national laboratories that develop advanced technologies and alternative energy sources like nuclear energy, according to Politico.Other responsibilities include setting standards for household appliances, conducting research on innovations like electric power generators and overseeing energy efficiency programs for homes and businesses.The Energy Department under former President Barack Obama promoted the use of renewables like solar and wind energy, oversaw the Iran nuclear deal and pushed for the Paris Climate Accord, according to The Atlantic. But under President Trump, the department promoted fossil fuel production and overturned regulations.Granholm has positioned herself as a figure who can help the energy industry transition towards renewables and clean energy sources. A key element of Biden’s climate plan includes a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a transition away from fossil fuels. (RELATED: ‘Mandates And Regulations’: Economist Nicholas Loris On Biden’s Energy And Environment Platform)“The private sector needs greater support and political will from our policymakers to help us fully realize the potential of a zero-carbon future,” Granholm wrote in a Nov. 7 op-ed. “The economics are clear: The time for a low-carbon recovery is now.”Granholm’s connections to the auto industry and her support for an electric transportation grid would likely play a key role in Biden’s energy policy if confirmed, according\\xa0to Politico. The transportation sector is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the country and a clean energy transition would likely require the adoption of electric cars and other forms of transport.'},\n",

That’s not correct. In November, 1,740,795 people requested a mail-in ballot. 1,362,369 — actually exercised it, voted by mail, so today, the requests are half a million less, a third less than they were for the November election, and what you also need to remember is 600,000 of the people on the list for mail-in ballots, 600,000 of that 1.7 million are automatically on the list. They are on the list for a long time. They sign up for permanent mail-in ballots, so they are counted as a request, but we don’t know whether or not they are actually going to vote.The Republican strategist argued that only 52% of those who had at this point voted in the general election have returned their ballots. (RELATED: Lamar Alexander Spars With Chuck Todd On Trump Concession: ‘What About Stacey Abrams’ Concession Speech?’)“They are less Democrat, they are less black, and 60% plus of them are 66 years or older, meaning more likely to be Republican voters,” he said. “So I don’t know what her deal was there, except to sort of raise expectations that they were already in the lead, but this is a fight to the finish, and the Republicans are doing pretty good right now.”Later in the interview, Rove contended that only 12,130 of the 85,000 applicants were actually new voters.'},\n",

Hunter Biden’s business dealings with China remains the primary focus of the investigation, which began in 2018, CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz reported.The probe was put on hold during Joe Biden’s campaign for executive office, Prokupecz wrote.“I learned yesterday for the first time that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Hunter Biden said in the statement.“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.”Days later, federal investigators announced Hunter Biden was the subject of scrutiny related to his business dealings with one of China’s largest energy companies, CEFC. The corporation, which holds possible ties to the country’s communist regime, wired approximately $6 million dollars to accounts and firms controlled by the President-elect’s son between 2017 and 2018. (RELATED: DOJ Probe Of Hunter Biden Is More Extensive Than He Let On, And Could Involve Chinese Business Deals)Some of the wire transfers were flagged for criminal activity in a report released by Senate Republicans, the DCNF found. Another transfer from a Russian billionaire in 2014, which amounted to $3.5 million, was also flagged in the GOP findings.Hunter Biden was later subpoenaed by federal authorities to release his foreign business records with more than two dozen companies, according to the Associated Press. Ukranian energy company Burisma, where the President-elect’s son held a senior role, and multiple Chinese firms were named in the report, AP reported.Hunter Biden gained national attention in October when he reportedly dropped his computer hard drive at a Delaware repair shop and never picked it up, according to the New York Post. The hard drive contained lewd images of the President-elect’s son and a more clear picture of his business dealings with the Ukrainian firm, where he served in a high-level role for a salary of $50,000 per month, the Post reported.The founder of the cybersecurity firm Errata Security Robert Graham told the Daily Caller News Foundation that one email in the drive, which was obtained by the DCNF for review, was “unquestionably authentic.” The email possibly linked both Joe and Hunter Biden to the Ukrainian business.In the 2015 message, Vadym Pozharsky, an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors, thanked Hunter Biden for “inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.”Cybersecurity expert Robert Graham said this email is unquestionably authentic after analyzing its DKIM signature. (Robert Graham)The email purportedly contradicts a claim from Joe Biden that he “had never spoken” to his “son about his overseas business dealings,” the Post reported. Moreover, Hunter Biden’s ex-business partner Tony Bobulinski in late October suggested that the President-elect was well aware of his son’s foreign relationships.Bobulinski said in a press conference that he, alongside both Joe and Hunter Biden, discussed financial relationships in 2017 when the trio discussed a joint venture deal between Oneida Holdings and CEFC. (RELATED: Here Are All The Times Joe Biden Allegedly Talked With Hunter About His Foreign Business Dealings)“I have heard Joe Biden say he’s never discussed business with Hunter,” said\\xa0Bobulinski. “That is false.”“I was introduced to Joe Biden by Jim Biden and Hunter Biden,” Bobulinski said. “In my approximately hour-long meeting with Joe that night we discussed Biden’s history, the Biden family business plans with the Chinese, with which he was plainly familiar, at least at a high level.”Further analysis of the hard-drive by the DCNF showed that Joe Biden offered his son financial assistance at least four times between November of 2018 and March of 2019.“Dad can you please cash app me $2,000,” Hunter Biden texted Joe Biden on March 15, 2019. “I’m again overdrawn in my account for bills that can’t be left unpaid.”“I’ll have it all paid back next week I hope,” Hunter Biden texted his father after Joe Biden was asked if the transfer went through.Multiple emails and text messages appeared to paint a picture of financial distress for Hunter Biden. The President-elect’s son in one message exchange asks a business partner for a $50,000 wire transfer while he’s stuck at a gas pump with no money in his account.“Buddy do you have cash app to send me … $100 until wire goes,” Hunter Biden emailed his business partner Jeff Cooper. “I have no I have no money for gas and im literally stuck at a rest stop on 95 on my way from Boston to DC.”Email sent from Hunter Biden to Jeff Cooper on March 4, 2019. (screenshot)Political figures have raised concerns about the investigation carrying over past Joe Biden’s inauguration.“That should not be investigated by someone appointed by the president any more than if one of his cabinet members is accused of something or his national security adviser,” former ethics counsel to President George W. Bush Richard Painter told the New York Times.“This is the opportunity for the incoming president and attorney general, whoever he chooses, to say this is exactly why we need an office of special counsel,” he continued.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We’re compounding loss,” Barbara Duffield, who advocates for homeless children through SchoolHouse Connection, told NBC. “A student who is homeless, who has a disability, who has been traumatized by the racial violence we’ve seen this year, and then to be disconnected from arguably the only universal support system is disastrous.”“It means higher rates of suicide,” she continued. “Higher rates of depression, addiction, mental illness and physical disability, particularly for young children who are growing and developing right now. They’ll face more developmental delays leading to deficits in their education as they grow.”And it will be the most vulnerable children who will be most strongly affected, director of Educational Opportunities Project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, David Hinojosa, told the publication.

Washington has been targeted for being a “slaveowner, colonizer” according to the committee’s spreadsheet.Jefferson Elementary is also on the list, despite Thomas Jefferson’s authorship of the Declaration of Independence.Not all community members are on board for the changes though. Jonathon Alloy, whose children attend one of the schools on the renaming list, said changing the names is a waste of resources, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.“Principals are devoting resources to this,” he said. “We’re being presented with it as a fait accompli.”Officials from five high school alumni associations criticized the board and said they needed to consult professional historians, according to the report.“We need an inclusive process that will allow all communities to be heard, use professional historians applying verifiable data, issue a written report why a school name might be changed, so the community can make a considered decision.”'},\n",

However, several are coming back in a demoted position.Susan Rice, who once served as the national security adviser under former President Barack Obama was picked by Biden to lead the White House Domestic Policy Council, Politico reported. Rice was also reportedly considered for the role of Secretary of State, but the position was given to Antony Blinken, who served as Deputy National Security Advisor from 2013-2015 and Deputy Secretary of State from 2015-2017.As a member of the Domestic Policy Council, Rice will be tasked with coordinating policy-making decision processes and ensuring that policies and programs put forth are in line with the president’s goals. On the other hand, the national security adviser advises the president on matters related to national security while also assisting the president with meetings with world leaders.Rice came under fire in 2017 after she unmasked the identities of senior officials in President Donald Trump’s administration. She was accused of improperly unmasking the officials who were identified in reports compiled by the intelligence community.Rice also once pushed for military action in Libya while serving as ambassador to the United Nations under Obama — a move Biden opposed, according to Politico.Samantha Power was once a member of the National Security Council, joining the Obama White House in 2009. By 2011, she was pushing for military intervention in Libya despite Biden, who was then vice president, opposing the no-fly zone which Obama later supported. (RELATED: Trump Promises ‘More To Come’ In His Legal Fight Despite Biden’s Official Electoral College Win)However, Biden is considering Power to lead the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), according to Axios.

Paul Mitchell left the GOP because of Trump before asking Romney if he is concerned the party won’t “be able to overcome Trumpism in the near future.”WATCH:“Well, I think President Trump will continue to have substantial influence on the party,” Romney responded. “And I think if you look at the people who are rumored to be thinking of running in 2024, besides the president, those are people who are trying to appeal to kind of a populist approach, so I don’t think Trumpism is going away.”Romney, a frequent Trump critic, went on to express hope that “disagreements over policy and the vision of our respective parties” can be had without “continuing to promote a narrative which puts democracy itself in jeopardy.”“And when you tell people that voting doesn’t work and that democracy can’t work because we don’t have legitimate elections, that’s a very dangerous thing to be saying,” he added.

There’s no business that I know of in America that can’t be sued for their actions and not subject to regulation by the government at any level, except big tech,” Graham explained.The senator pledged “to introduce legislation that would repeal Section 230, Jan. 1, 2023, which would give the Congress two years to replace it with something better and if we can’t find that something better it goes away.”“And you and the New York Post and Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham can sue these bastards when they try to censor content,” the senator said.A September 2020 survey revealed that more than half of American voters support breaking up big tech companies.Graham insisted there is also bipartisan support for restraining big tech and said, “I’ve had Democrats come up to me and say ‘we hate these big tech companies as much as you do. They’ve abused power, they’re American companies, they’ve created technology that enriches our lives, but they’ve got more power than anybody in the history of the world in terms of information flow.’”“They have a political bias,” Graham continued. “They’re protected from lawsuits and they’re not regulated by the government. That needs to come to an end.”Graham also said Republicans need to focus on the Senate runoff election in Georgia.“If we lose Georgia, Bernie Sanders will become the budget chairman, not Lindsey Graham so your money’s at stake,” Graham stated, adding that the Democratic leadership will then be able to expand the number of judges on the Supreme Court from nine to 13 and “make it liberal.”He also warned of statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico while saying legislation like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All will become realities with a Democratic controlled Senate.

Ted Kennedy, is publicly campaigning to be President-elect Joe Biden’s “drug czar” when he takes office in January.“I have no shame in saying it: I believe I could do better than anyone else,” Kennedy said during an interview with STAT News when asked about the possibility of him directing the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).Kennedy, who retired from Congress in 2011, would likely be a polarizing pick given his history as CEO of the Kennedy Forum, a nonprofit which was funded in part by major pharmaceutical companies and addiction-treatment facilities, Politico reported in 2018.Kennedy made more than $1.1 million while leading the nonprofit from 2014 to 2016, and since then has served on President Donald Trump’s opioid commission, a role that benefitted his nonprofit work as well, according to the report.The former congressman also sat on the board of eight different corporations that all stood to gain financially from the Trump administration’s response to the opioid crisis. While in his respective positions, Kennedy lobbied his former colleagues on the Hill to push for higher spending levels towards treatments and anti-opioid drugs, according to Politico.“I see this as a historic turning point for mental health and addiction. The headlines may be about a respiratory illness, but I think the legacy of this thing is going to be the brain illnesses that it causes through the trauma of dislocation, stress, uncertainty, and the self-medication that comes with all of that,” Kennedy told STAT News, referring to the additional tolls imposed by the coronavirus pandemic.Former U.S. Representative and founder of The Kennedy Forum Patrick J. Kennedy was among the advocates speaking at The Kennedy Forum National Summit On Mental Health Equity And Justice In Chicago on January 16, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. (Jeff Schear/Getty Images for Kennedy Forum)Though the ONDCP operated without great attention during President Donald Trump’s term, whoever holds it is the nation’s highest-ranking drug policy official. The position could play an outsized role in a Biden administration as the country seeks to move past the ongoing opioid epidemic and the coronavirus pandemic, which has worsened drug abuse and mental health\\xa0throughout the United States.But some of Kennedy’s views may be out of step with most Democrats. He opposes legal marijuana for recreational use, calling it “commercialization of a new big tobacco industry” during the STAT interview, and supports the criminal justice system mandating treatment programs for those convicted of low-level drug offenses.\\xa0(RELATED: Kennedy Kicks Off Anti-Marijuana Campaign)“You cannot ignore the value of the criminal justice system to focus people when they’re not in a position to necessarily focus on wanting recovery,” he said. As someone who long struggled with addiction and mental health, Kennedy credited the criminal justice system for his own recovery, according to STAT.Spokespersons for the Biden transition did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment on Kennedy’s push to lead the ONDCP in the incoming administration.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

California was one of the last states to vote, along with several battleground states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which also voted for Biden Monday.\\xa0Trump has refused to concede the election, and filed a motion to intervene a week prior in a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which sought to invalidate votes from four of the battleground states over voter fraud allegations. The lawsuit was rejected by the Supreme Court, dealing a blow to Trump and his allies who sought to overturn the 2020 election results. (RELATED: Texas GOP Chair Suggests ‘Law-Abiding States’ Form Their Own Union After Supreme Court Rejects Lawsuit To Overturn Election Results)Wiconsin’s Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit earlier Monday from Trump’s campaign seeking to overturn his election loss in the state.“The only reason the country is caring about the drama of the electoral college votes — which is normally not any kind of drama at all — is because of Trump’s continued insistence that he’s going to be able to pull a rabbit out of the hate [sic] and remain in office,” Rick Hasen, an election law expert at University of California Law School said, according to CAP radio.\\xa0“There’s no legal path for him to do that.”The voting took place in states capitals with modifications due to the pandemic. In some states, there was heightened security due to threats of violence.\\xa0Republican electors turned out in the states Biden won to vote for Trump, and in Pennsylvania, Republican electors said they cast a “procedural vote” just in case the courts determined that Trump had won despite rejections of challenges to Biden’s victory. In states where Trump won, like North Carolina and Utah, his electors duly cast votes for him.Biden is expected to speak Monday evening, and has emphasized his promise to represent all Americans, no matter who they voted for.“We the people voted. Faith in our institutions held. The integrity of our elections remains intact. And so, now it is time to turn the page. To unite. To heal,” the remarks prepared for the speech said, according to the Associated Press.\\xa0IT’S OVER: California cast its 55 electoral votes for Biden.

In the warning, the U.S. government said the software was compromised by “malicious actors,” Reuters reports. (RELATED: US Treasury Emails Monitored By Suspected Russian Hackers)The warning came after a Reuters report Sunday that claimed Russian hackers had used SolarWinds software updates to infiltrate U.S. government agencies like the Treasury Department.The Commerce Department confirmed the security breach in a statement Sunday. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are currently investigating the hack.Earlier this month, The National Security Agency warned that “Russian state-sponsored actors” were trying to exploit a different system widely used by the U.S. government.U.S. officials suspect Russia is behind the hacking operation, but Russia has denied these allegations, according to Reuters.CISA is the DHS arm tasked with handling various cyber security efforts. Part of those efforts include protecting election integrity, according to CISA’s website. One source said the DHS infrastructure surrounding election security had not been corrupted, according to Reuters. The department said it was aware of the reports, but did not comment on how badly the department’s cyber security network was affected, if at all, according to Reuters.“The United States government is aware of these reports, and we are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation,” National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot said in a statement, The New York Times reports.SolarWinds believes the breach originated with nefarious code inserted into an update for the Orion network management software by an “outside nation state” between March and June of this year, according to Reuters.SolarWinds asks all customers to upgrade immediately to Orion Platform version 2020.2.1 HF 1 to address a security vulnerability. More information is available at https://t.co/scsUhZJCk8— SolarWinds (@solarwinds) December 14, 2020“SolarWinds currently believes the actual number of customers that may have had an installation of the Orion products that contained this vulnerability to be fewer than 18,000,” the technology company said in a statement, Reuters reports. Among SolarWinds’ 300,000 global customers are a majority of Fortune 500 companies, as well as various world governments, according to Reuters. The White House, U.S. Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies for the U.S. and the U.K. are among SolarWinds’ clientele, Reuters reports.SolarWinds told Reuters they were unaware of any other breaches and were helping the U.S. government investigate.An organization that had installed the corrupted Orion update would have given hackers access to a back door where the hackers could access the rest of the computer system, according to three unnamed sources in the Reuters report. “After that, it’s just a question of whether the attackers decide to exploit that access further,” one of the sources told Reuters.Since the hackers can keep their backdoors open with access to the Orion software, SolarWinds customers are scrambling to trace back the hacker’s digital footprints to the source of these breaches in order to permanently lock the hackers out, Reuters reports.'},\n",

The decision may have effectively ended the Trump campaign’s election challenge in the state.The president’s lawsuit against Wisconsin’s elections commission sought to invalidate more than 221,000 absentee ballots in Dane and Milwaukee counties for purportedly failing to meet certain requirements. The lawsuit also requested the Republican-led state legislature to appoint pro-Trump electors to the Electoral College.Breaking: #Wisconsin Supreme Court rules against Trump Campaign.“We conclude the Campaign is not entitled to the relief it seeks.”Full text of decision:https://t.co/cvABccJEEm pic.twitter.com/QIzF9jBdQr— Ryan Goodman (@rgoodlaw) December 14, 2020Wisconsin’s Supreme Court previously declined to hear the lawsuit until it had gone through the state’s lower courts. A state court judge ruled against the election challenge Dec. 11 and the Trump campaign appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.The court’s ruling Monday relied on a legal doctrine mandating that plaintiffs in a lawsuit should not unreasonably delay in seeking relief, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. Hagedorn said the Trump campaign delayed in bringing its lawsuit forward and that ruling on an election more than one month later was “unreasonable in the extreme.”“Our laws allow the challenge flag to be thrown regarding various aspects of election administration,” Hagedorn wrote in the majority opinion, using a sports analogy. “The challenges raised by the Campaign in this case, however, come long after the last play or even the last game; the Campaign is challenging the rulebook adopted before the season began.”But the three dissenting conservative justices, including Chief Justice Patience Roggensack, argued that the court should have ruled on whether the absentee ballots in question were valid instead of rejecting the campaign’s claims outright, according to the Associated Press.“A significant portion of the public does not believe that the November 3, 2020, presidential election was fairly conducted,” Roggensack wrote. “Once again, four justices on this court cannot be bothered with addressing what the statutes require to assure that absentee ballots are lawfully cast.”Wisconsin’s electors met inside Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ office roughly an hour after the court’s decision to cast the state’s 10 electoral votes for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, WKOW reported.

The pornography website had about 13.5 million videos before it began purging, the publication reported, and many of these videos were from unverified accounts.A Pornhub spokesman declined to tell the Daily Caller News Foundation how many videos the website had removed, but noted that the “current number of videos can be seen in the search bar on our homepage.”The DCNF confirmed that the Pornhub search bar offers 2,913,964 videos as of Monday evening, meaning that Pornhub appears to have removed over 78% of its videos since Sunday evening.Screenshot, Pornhub.The website had only 4.7 million videos as of Monday morning, Vox reported, and the most-viewed non-verified video made by an amateur (which had over 29 million views) had also been removed.“As part of our policy to ban unverified uploaders, we have now also suspended all previously uploaded content that was not created by content partners or members of the Model Program,” Pornhub announced.\\xa0“This means every piece of Pornhub content is from verified uploaders, a requirement that platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter have yet to institute.”The popular\\xa0pornography website has been listed as the 10th-most-visited website in the world, with 3.5 billion visits a month and profits from almost three billion ad impressions every day, according to Kristof. Before Pornhub began purging content, anyone who created a Pornhub account could upload videos to the site since it first launched in 2017, according to Vox.“Pornhub’s removal of millions of videos by unverified users is a huge deal, for most of the horrible videos I saw were in this category,” Kristof tweeted Monday. “Pressure should be also applied on XVideos, which has a bigger audience and less monitoring. Pressure has to be evenly applied to be effective.”Kristof’s story sparked a backlash against Pornhub, prompting lawmakers like Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse to call for investigations into the pornography website. (RELATED: Sasse Demands Full Investigation After Pornhub Rapidly Changes Policies Over Allegations Of Child Sexual Exploitation)“Just the other day Pornhub was insisting that it didn’t have a problem with rape and assault videos, and that its ‘vast team of human moderators’ was magically capable of working around the clock to review the 2.8 hours of video that were uploaded to the site every minute,” Sasse said in a statement to the DCNF after Pornhub announced that it would implement changes.“Today, they’re doing a complete 180 by changing their policies,” Sasse added. “These new changes underscore the need for a full DOJ investigation.”Mindgeek, Pornhub’s parent company, has not responded to multiple requests for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Rhoades of Fort Wayne-South Bend and Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City in Kansas said in a document released Monday.The bishops noted that “while neither vaccine is completely free from any connection to morally compromised cell lines, in this case the connection is very remote from the initial evil of the abortion.”The AstraZeneca vaccine, however, is “more morally compromised” and thus “should be avoided,”the bishops said.

Analysis from the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) found that most of the major vaccine candidates do not use cell lines derived from abortions in their production, though several used abortion-derived cell lines in laboratory testing.AstraZeneca uses abortion-derived cell lines in development, production, and lab testing, the analysis found. Pfizer and Moderna sometimes abortion-derived cells in testing but do not use abortion-derived cell lines in development or production of the vaccine, the analysis found.CLI Vice President Dr. David Prentice previously explained to the Daily Caller News Foundation that when abortion-derived cell lines are used in the production of a vaccine, that means the cells are “directly involved in making the final product, the vaccine that is injected in our arms.”“It is an essential element for the final vaccine,” Prentice said of abortion-derived cell lines used in the production of a vaccine. “Although the connection is distant both in time and space, since the abortion occurred decades ago and the cells have been grown in the lab ever since, that connection to abortion remains and is of concern to many Americans. ”Laboratory testing using abortion-derived cell lines is potentially less morally problematic, since it is “anther step removed” Prentice said.“When an abortion-derived cell line is used in laboratory testing, that is not done within the production line,” he explained. “It’s a confirmatory test done on the final vaccine, to validate what the scientists believe they’ve produced.”“So this is another step removed, and there was nothing touching the abortion-derived cell line that ended up in the final vaccine product, or in our arms,” he continued. “For some, it doesn’t completely remove the concern. It is important to note that there are testing methods that can be done with cells not derived from abortion.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Sheriff Joining Republican Party Because Democratic Leadership Has Condoned ‘101 Days Of Rioting’)When asked if he was also motivated to embrace the Republicans because of the prevalence of the defund the police movement in the Democratic Party, Custer said it was “a definite factor” and after being in law enforcement for 30 years he felt betrayed.“Hey, this is not the what I signed up for,” he said.The sheriff said he believes he has broad public support for his decision to reject the Democrats “and that’s why I was one of 40 individual sheriffs here in the state of Pennsylvania to endorse President [Donald] Trump as our law and order president.”President-elect Joe Biden has never endorsed the defund the police supporters within the Democratic Party or congressional caucus.

Their six educators. And I think about the time we have spent with each other grieving since then,” he wrote. “I remain in awe of you. I have heard from and watched as so many of you turned pain into purpose, working to change our laws and our culture around gun violence and how we protect and nurture our children.”Biden noted that gun reform may seem “like an impossible task,” but thanked young activists for helping “usher in a collective and growing purpose.”WASHINGTON, DC – APRIL 17: Mark Barden, the father of a victim at Sandy Hook Elementary School, joins U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden in making a statement on gun violence in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 17, 2013 in Washington, DC.\\xa0(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)“You’ve helped us forge a consensus that gun violence is a national health crisis and we need to address its total cost to fully heal families, communities, and our nation,” he continued. “Eight years later, there have been plenty of thoughts and prayers, but we know that is not enough. Together with you and millions of our fellow Americans of every background all across our nation, we will fight to end this scourge on our society and enact common sense reforms that are supported by a majority of Americans and that will save countless lives.”Biden stated just last week during a closed door meeting that he would not enact gun reform through executive action. (RELATED: Joe Biden’s Gun Plan Could Bankrupt The Firearms Industry, Advocates Say)“I am not going to violate the Constitution,” he can be heard saying on leaked audio from the meeting. “Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bound.”“There’s no executive authority to do away that,” he explained of a sweeping “assault weapons” ban. “No one has fought harder to get rid of assault weapons than me, me, but you can’t do it by executive order. We do that, next guy comes along and says, well, guess what? By executive order, I guess everybody can have machine guns again. So we’ve got to be careful.”LISTEN:President Barack Obama, like Biden, has frequently referred to the Sandy Hook massacre as the most difficult day of his presidency and listed not pushing harder for gun reform as one of the largest regrets of his time in the White House.'},\n",

(Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images)Levinson vanished while visiting Iran’s Kish Island in March of 2007. His detention marked the longest such period Iran had ever held an American prisoner, and in March 2020, his family and the U.S. government declared that he had likely died in captivity. A U.S. judge ordered in October of 2020 that Iran pay $1.45 billion to Levinson’s family, and the U.S. government has issued a $20 million reward since 2012 for any information surrounding the case.Monday’s sanctions mark the first time that any Iranian officials have been specifically named in the Levinson case.A senior U.S. government official added during Monday’s briefing that the designation “puts the abduction squarely on the shoulders of the Iranian regime” and is “long overdue.”“We are still working hard to bring him home and bring closure and justice to his family,” the official stated. “There should never be an agreement negotiated with Iran ever again,” that does not include “the return home of all Americans unjustly detained in that country.”“Since the beginning of this Administration, President Trump has made it clear that Iran will be held accountable for its use of detention and hostage taking as a tool of “diplomacy” and that the United States will no longer accept Iranian excuses for what we know they have done to Mr. Levinson,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said of Monday’s announcement. “No family should ever endure the pain the Levinson family has for nearly 14 years. Iran is responsible and can end this nightmare by answering questions for which only they hold the answers. Any future talks with Iran must include resolution to this case. We stand by the Levinson family, and we will never cease in our efforts to bring justice for Bob and his family.”President Donald Trump had previously denied that Levinson had died in captivity.“I don’t accept it,” Trump said at a press briefing in March. “I don’t accept that he’s dead.”This is a developing story and will be updated with new information as it becomes available.\\xa0'},\n",

The sign burning was captured on Twitter. It pained me especially to see our name, Asbury, in flames. For me it was reminiscent of cross burnings,” Mills wrote. “Seeing this act on video made me both indignant and determined to fight the evil that has reared its ugly head. We had been so confident that no one would ever vandalize the church, but it has happened.”April Goggans, an organizer with Black Lives Matter D.C., also released a statement accusing the police department of protecting white supremacists throughout the demonstrations.“Yesterday, D.C. was invaded by white supremacists who were aided and protected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). We never expect police to protect Black people or anyone critical of police; and the people of D.C. need to be clear MPD physically protected white supremacists, as they threatened lives, damaged historic churches and destroyed and burned property. MPD allowed Proud Boys to physically attack D.C. residents who stood against white supremacy,” Goggans said.'},\n",

The legal theory put forward by his legal team and by the president is an absurdity, and the reason why the Supreme Court didn’t take it is because it’s an absurd idea to think that any state or any number of states, no matter how good they are, can challenge another state’s right to run the election as they see fit,” Christie replied.“And also, there’s no evidence. As I have been saying since election night, show us the evidence,” Christie continued.

The law firm filed a motion to unseal Steele’s notes, which were disclosed in a defamation case that the owners of the Russian bank Alfa Bank filed against Steele over allegations he made in the dossier.Steele’s attorneys offered to provide the lawyers in London with his witness statements in the Alfa Bank case, but have not turned over notes he took during the FBI meetings, according to Politico.A prosecutor for Durham’s office requested an interview with Steele in February, but he declined the request, Politico also reported.Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, has been investigating the FBI and the CIA’s intelligence-gathering activities against the Trump campaign since May 2019. His investigation appears to have tracked closely with the findings of a Justice Department inspector general’s (IG) report released on Dec. 9, 2019, that blasted the FBI over its handling of the Steele dossier.The Politico report indicates that Durham is investigating aspects of the dossier, which Steele compiled on behalf of the the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.Politico cited anonymous sources who speculated that Durham is looking into whether FBI agents disclosed classified information to Steele during the 2016 interviews. Steele’s meeting on July 5, 2016, was with his longtime FBI handler, Michael Gaeta.Steele shared a memo he compiled as part of the dossier in which he alleged that the Kremlin was blackmailing Donald Trump with video of him with prostitutes in Moscow.A team of agents met with Steele again in October 2016, months after the bureau had opened its investigation of the Trump campaign, dubbed Crossfire Hurricane.FBI agents who took part in the meeting told the IG’s office that they were troubled to learn later that Steele had talked to members of the media prior to that meeting.Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS, met with reporters from Yahoo! News, The Washington Post, The New York Times and The New Yorker in September 2016.Yahoo! News published a story based on the meeting with Steele on Sept. 23, 2016. The article cited Steele’s allegations about Carter Page, which the FBI also used in its applications for surveillance warrants against the former Trump adviser.Gaeta, who was Steele’s handling agent, told the IG that it “blew his mind” that Steele had talked with the press because it would have put his source network in danger.Another FBI agent told the IG’s office that Steele “clearly … wasn’t truthful with us” regarding his contacts with the media.“Clearly,” the agent reiterated, according to the IG report.The IG report said that FBI agents told Steele during the interview that they were investigating Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. That information had not been publicly disclosed at the time.The FBI relied heavily on information from Steele as part of its investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Investigators extensively cited Steele’s information in applications to surveil Trump campaign aide Carter Page.Carter Page, former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, speaks to the media after testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)The Justice Department IG report excoriated the FBI for relying on Steele’s information without first verifying it.U.S. lawmakers have accused Steele of lying to the FBI in 2016 regarding his meetings with journalists to discuss the dossier.Sens. Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham asked the Justice Department and the FBI in January 2018 to investigate whether Steele provided misleading statements to the bureau regarding his contacts with the media.The FBI ended up cutting ties with Steele on Oct. 31, 2016, after he served as a source for a story published by Mother Jones that details allegations from the dossier.Steele testified that he deleted many of his dossier-related communications in January 2017. A State Department official who worked with Steele on the project, Jonathan Winer, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Steele directed him to delete their correspondence on the topic as well.Notes from Steele’s interviews in September 2017 with the FBI as part of the special counsel’s probe also show that he did not disclose that he met with journalists in September 2016.According to the FBI employees’ notes, Steele apologized for going to the media, but said that he found himself “riding two horses” — the FBI and his client, Fusion GPS.The notes say that Steele explained that he went to the media at Fusion GPS’s direction after then-FBI Director James Comey announced he was re-opening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.“We had to pick ‘one horse’ and we chose the business ‘horse’ vs. the ‘FBI’ horse – hence, we followed what our client wanted and spoke to the press,” the notes describe Steele saying.Steele failed to disclose that by the time Comey announced reopening the Clinton probe, on Oct. 28, 2016, he had already met with multiple other journalists and served as a source for the Yahoo! News story.FBI notes from Christopher Steele interviews in September 2017, released by Senate Homeland Security and Senate Finance CommitteeThere is no indication from the FBI notes that the agents asked Steele whether he was a source for the Yahoo! story.The special counsel’s report debunked the core thesis of the dossier that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to release emails hacked from Democrats in order to influence the 2016 election. The special counsel’s report said that prosecutors found no evidence that Trump associates conspired with Russia or played any role in hacking Democrats’ emails.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump filed a motion to intervene Wednesday, which is a request for him to join the lawsuit. More than 120 House Republicans and 17 states also supported the suit.The lawsuit alleged that the four states cited the coronavirus pandemic in order to make changes to their election laws that violated federal law and that allowed for voter fraud to occur. It also asked the court to block the certification of the Electoral College votes and extend the Dec. 14 deadline, which would allow time to investigate election results.The Supreme Court rejected Republicans’ attempt to reverse Pennsylvania’s certification of its election results Tuesday, which led to the certification of Biden’s victory in the state.

Blumenthal said Barrett’s participation would cause “explosive, enduring harm to the court’s legitimacy,” according to the report.All 50 states have certified their election results and the Supreme Court rejected an emergency request from Pennsylvania Republicans to block the election results Tuesday.However, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, in a bid supported by President Donald Trump and 17 other Republican-led states, asked the high court Tuesday for an emergency order to invalidate the ballots in the four battleground states of Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Trump filed a motion to intervene\\xa0Wednesday, which is a request for him to join the lawsuit. (RELATED: ‘New California’ And ‘New Nevada’ File Brief In Support Of Texas-Led Lawsuit Seeking To Overturn Election Results)The suit asked the court to block the certification of the Electoral College votes because the suit alleged that the four states had illegal votes. Paxton argued that pandemic-era changes in election procedures violated federal law.“Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification, government officials in the defendant states of Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, usurped their legislatures’ authority and unconstitutionally revised their state’s election statues,” the suit read.Paxton said states used executive orders to change the election process and hurt voting integrity by not “protecting” signature verification and witness requirements.The suit also alleged\\xa0that the states didn’t segregate late ballots that would allow an “accurate analysis to determine which ballots were cast in conformity with the legislatively set rules and which were not.”In October, the Supreme Court refused to expedite Pennsylvania Republicans’ challenge to a state Supreme Court ruling that allowed ballots to be received and counted as valid up to three days after the election even if they lacked a postmark because the high court was under the impression that Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar would order late ballots to be segregated.Boockvar initially complied and issued guidance on Oct. 28 ordering all late ballots to be kept separate in case the Supreme Court ruled the extension unconstitutional.However, she then updated the guidance last minute on Nov. 1, ordering all ballots that arrived before Nov. 6 to be counted as valid.Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ordered Nov. 6 that all late ballots must be segregated despite Boockvar’s guidance.'},\n",

Thomas, reads, making up two new sub-states.“Part of the reason for the formation of New California State and New Nevada State is to stop the lawless actions of Governors Newsom (California) and Sisolak (Nevada). An opinion by this Court affirming a national, uniform rule of law re-establishing the supremacy of The Electors Clause of…the Constitution will resolve some of the complaints causing the establishment of these new States,” the brief continued.The brief alleges that “in the existing States of California and Nevada” there is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, noting voters in both states received unsolicited mail-in ballots even though voters are supposed to request an absentee ballot.SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA – AUGUST 16: California Gov. Gavin Newsom looks on during a news conference with California attorney General Xavier Becerra at the California State Capitol on August 16, 2019 in Sacramento, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order in May sending mail-in ballots to all registered California voters for the November elections due to coronavirus concerns. (RELATED: Hillary Clinton Says Republicans Who Back Trump’s Election Challenge ‘Have No Spines’)The Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the California Republican Party sued over the order, arguing the order would lead to fraud because the state could potentially mail ballots to inactive voters which “invites fraud, coercion, theft and otherwise illegitimate voting,” according to CNN.Similarly, a federal judge in Nevada dismissed a suit in September filed by President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign that sought to overturn a mail-in voting law that also mandated all active voters in the state would be sent a mail-in ballot regardless of if they requested one.The brief also argues that in Nevada ballots without postmarks were accepted after the election, creating confusion.The same new Nevada law that mandated mass mail-in ballots be sent out also permitted late ballots without postmarks to be counted as valid.The brief also argues that there was no uniform process among counties to handle absentee ballots, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.In Nevada, the new law only required at least one location in a county or city have a drop box for mail in ballots, which the Trump campaign had also argued violated the Equal Protections Clause because it would disenfranchise voters in rural areas.The suit notes that if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Texas-led suit, then it will settle legal debates taking place in California and Nevada over whether executive orders that overstepped state legislature authority were constitutional.Judge Sarah H. Heckman of the Superior Court of California County of Sutter ruled Nov. 2 that Newsom’s June 3 executive order, which amended the number of available polling stations, among other things, was unconstitutional. However, Newsom has appealed the decision, prompting “New California State” and “New Nevada State” to file the brief in hopes a decision could settle the appeals case.'},\n",

Bernie Sanders and Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who argued that Congress needed to provide direct cash payments to families as part of any coronavirus relief.WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 11: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) wears a protective mask while departing the U.S. Capitol. Lawmakers are facing a midnight deadline to pass a continuing resolution to avert a partial shutdown and fund the government for another week. (Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images)“This Congress must address the economic emergency facing the American people,” Sanders said during a speech on the Senate floor Friday. “I am prepared to withdraw my objection at this moment, but I will not be prepared to withdraw an objection next week. We will deal with the financial crisis facing tens of millions of Americans.”If a long-term government funding bill is unable to pass before next Friday, Congress may be forced to stay in Washington for the holidays.“If the Senate of the united states can find hundreds of billions of dollars to give to big government and big business, surely it can find some relief for working families and working individuals,” Hawley said, echoing Sanders. “And I would just submit to you that it is working families and working people who should be first in line for COVID relief, not last, and that is why the amendment that Senator Sanders and I have proposed is so common sense.”Congress has so far been unable to compromise on a long-awaited stimulus bill. Throughout the fall, House Democrats, Senate Republicans and the White House have publicly disagreed on how large a stimulus should be, with Democrats favoring a bill over $2 trillion and Senate Republicans favoring one less than half the size. (RELATED: Pelosi Slams Trump For Rejecting A Stimulus Deal Before The Election)Last week a bipartisan group of lawmakers reached a $908 billion compromise that would provide funding for state, local and tribal governments, unemployment insurance, education, public transit and more. The stimulus has gained the support of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and President-elect Joe Biden, but it has yet to be endorsed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.A bipartisan group of senators on Tuesday proposed a $908 billion coronavirus stimulus package, in one of the few concrete steps toward COVID relief made by Congress in several monthHere’s the framework: https://t.co/Dhli52icvt pic.twitter.com/6mHCdLVaoV— Alayna Treene (@alaynatreene) December 1, 2020 The White House presented a $916 billion stimulus Tuesday, but it was rejected outright by Democrats over its lessening of unemployment benefits and failure to provide weekly unemployment payments, which expired in July. (RELATED: Dick Durbin: Democrats Stalled On Coronavirus Relief ‘Because An Election Was Coming’)The $908 billion plan would instead send weekly unemployment checks of $300 for 16 weeks, and provide additional money to states for vaccine distribution and administration.In lieu of weekly payments, the White House plan provides direct cash payments of $600 per adult and per child, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin touted as the best way of getting people back to work.“We obviously want to get people back to work,” Mnuchin said during a press briefing Wednesday, according to The New York Times. “By sending out checks, we’re putting money into the economy for people.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Senate passed the bill 84 to 13, and the House of Representatives passed it 335-78 on Wednesday.Both margins are greater than the two-thirds majority necessary to override a presidential veto, and if passed it would be the first time congress has overridden a Trump veto since he became president.Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to “Big Tech” (the only companies in America that have it – corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity. Our Country can never be safe & secure if we allow it to stand…..— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2020 Despite Trump’s opposition, lawmakers in both parties touted the bill and said that they expected it to become law.Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said the bill sent a “strong, bipartisan message to the American people” when his chamber passed it Wednesday. “Our service members and national security are more important than politics,” he said.His comments were echoed by Republican Rep. Paul Mitchell, who said that the “bipartisan vote affirms the importance of the NDAA for our military personnel and national security.” (RELATED: Senate Armed Services Chair Inhofe Vows To Press Forward With Defense Bill Despite Trump Veto Threat)Some worried that the defense bill would not be passed Friday after Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul objected over a provision that made it harder for Trump to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan. His objections prompted widespread pushback from his fellow lawmakers, including some in Republican leadership.The Senate also hopes to pass a stopgap budget bill Friday, which would fund the government through Dec. 18. Current government funding expires Saturday at midnight, and lawmakers hope that the extra week will give Congress more time to pass a long-term appropriations bill and a stimulus package to mitigate the economic hardships brought by the coronavirus pandemic.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: REP. RIGGLEMAN: Killing Soleimani Made Us All Safer — Take It From This Veteran)“These members know better. You can’t sit here and tell me that you don’t think that these 106 members of Congress don’t know better, can you?” Berman asked.“I can’t. I don’t know how to defend this,” Riggleman replied, adding that he had predicted that a lot of Republicans would support such challenges.“But I asked one of the individuals who signed on. And he said, ‘I’m not saying that this is going on. I just think we need more information.’ And my thing is, how much more information do we need? What is it, 1 in 50 or 1 in 51 for lawsuits?” Riggleman continued. “I think at this point the one loss record is not very good.”“Let’s play mad libs here. The Republican Party this morning is blank. Fill in the blank?” Berman shifted gears.“Oh, goodness, a one-worder. Is that what you’re asking for?” Riggleman asked.“I’ll give you up to ten,” Berman conceded.“Thank you for that.

COVID is real, the kraken is not. It’s that simple,” he said. “And that’s why I’ve been so outspoken, as you started with the clip of me speaking yesterday about conspiracy theories.”'},\n",

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has said Trump won’t concede until all of his legal challenges have been exhausted.While Trump has not formally conceded the election, he has authorized his administration to begin the transition process. He has also said he will “certainly” leave the White House if the Electoral College officially certifies Biden as the winner, which it will do on December 14.White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also held a call with White House aides in the days after the election to discuss priorities the administration could accomplish before Biden takes office on January 20th.Trump has floated the idea of not attending Biden’s inauguration ceremony and instead holding a competing rally in Florida.'},\n",

The camp’s director was forced to resign after at least five child abuse or neglect allegations were brought against him, the Free Beacon reported Thursday.Warnock served as the senior pastor of the Douglas Memorial Community Church at the time, which operated the Maryland camp known as Camp Farthest Out. (RELATED: Raphael Warnock Refused To Say If He Supports Court Packing During Georgia Senate Debate)In 2002, Warnock was arrested for allegedly interfering in a police investigation into child abuse allegations, according to the outlet. A police report obtained by the Free Beacon showed Warnock was arrested after he and another reverend were repeatedly warned not to interfere with police interviews. Despite the warnings, Warnock was allegedly “extremely uncooperative and disruptive” and instructed campers not to talk to investigators, including pulling one camper away by the arm while he was speaking to an investigator.Warnock still hasn’t answered questions about why he was arrested for obstructing a child abuse investigation.-What was the nature of the investigation?-When did Warnock first learn that there was an investigation into suspected child abuse? #GAPolhttps://t.co/N0cwWuppzc— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) December 11, 2020However, Warnock told the Baltimore Sun in 2002 that he was “only asserting that lawyers should be present when camp counselors were interviewed.” During a debate Sunday, Warnock claimed that officers “actually thanked me for my cooperation and for helping them,” which is the same thing that the deputy state attorney told the Baltimore Sun in 2002, according to the Free Beacon.The state attorney’s office later dropped the charges against Warnock.Douglas Memorial Community Church hired Warnock as a pastor in 2001, where Warnock said he served for “about five years.” Expanding the church’s summer camp program was a part of his responsibilities, the Free Beacon reported.A 2002 report obtained by the Free Beacon from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene listed 11 violations at the camp, including incomplete camper medical records, not having approval for plumbing and electrical systems, improper child abuse reporting systems, not having approval from the state fire marshal and failure to properly supervise the children.Maryland’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene revoked Camp Farthest Out’s certification to operate in 2003. According to records from the Department of Health, Camp Farthest Out failed to comply with fire and safety code requirements, and staff was not properly supervising campers while they were swimming – both of which were repeat violations from 2001. The camp’s operator also reportedly failed to properly report child abuse allegations or incidents.A July 10, 2003 letter from Camp Farthest Out’s lawyer Paul D. Shelton to the county prosecutor’s office obtained by the outlet lists several findings of child abuse filed against Brian Carter, the camp’s director. The Department of Social Services found five incidents of child abuse between January and March of 2003, according to the letter which was obtained by the Free Beacon. Shelton argued that they failed to report the allegations because the camp was not notified that they existed. (RELATED: Raphael Warnock Decried The ‘Moral Bankruptcy Of The American Church’ Because Of Lopsided Support For Trump)Camp Farthest Out appealed the decision to revoke their certification, according to the Free Beacon. They reached a settlement with the Department of Health where they agreed to remove Brian Carter from his position as camp director and remove two additional staffers, Drenard Tucker and Corey Ferguson. Camp Farthest Out also agreed to run proper criminal background checks and comply with proper child abuse reporting procedures, the Free Beacon reported.A Maryland couple filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in 2003 against Warnock, Camp Farthest Out, the Douglas Memorial Community Church, Tucker, and Ferguson. The Free Beacon was unable to obtain the court records, and an attorney for the couple declined to speak to the Free Beacon on the record.Two months after the case was settled in 2005, Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, hired Warnock as a pastor.'},\n",

Our rise up means rise up against racism, against tyranny, rise up against violence. No. my message was not one that was intended against the Trump people.

He did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.Critics of Northam’s comments pointed out that in-person attendance at religious services is a fundamental aspect of worship for many religions, particularly Catholicism.Fake Christians truly, deeply don’t understand Christianity. https://t.co/XGkcZPFXMn— Christopher Bedford (@CBedfordDC) December 10, 2020 Earlier this year Northam banned gatherings of 10 or more people through initial stay-at-home orders, restrictions which effectively banned church services. Authorities have arrested\\xa0multiple religious leaders for defying coronavirus orders, such as Pastor Tony Spell of the Louisiana Life Tabernacle church and Florida megachurch pastor Rodney Howard-Browne.In April, a Southern Virginia judge denied a request for a temporary injunction in Russell County resident Larry Hughes’s lawsuit saying that Virginia’s stay-at-home order violated religious freedom.

Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Eric Dreiband noted at the time that “for many people of faith, exercising religion is essential, especially during a crisis.”“The Commonwealth of Virginia has offered no good reason for refusing to trust congregants who promise to use care in worship in the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and other workers to do the same,” Dreiband said.Northam is not the only lawmaker who has been accused of restricting religious freedom during the pandemic. Governors and mayors across the United States have issued orders throughout the pandemic that restrict or prohibit religious services, and the DOJ has pushed back against such restrictions on multiple occasions.Gallup\\xa0polling released this week\\xa0found that only those who attended religious services weekly saw a positive change between 2019 and 2020 in how they rated their mental health. No other Demographic group in the Gallup poll saw a percentage increase in rating their mental health as excellent. (RELATED: Supreme Court Ruling Sends A Message Churches Can’t Be Treated Like ‘Second Class’ Citizens, Legal Experts Say)“Houses of worship and religious services provide so much more than just a weekly meeting place — they are where so many Americans find strength, community, and meaning,” the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty’s Director of Research Caleb Lyman told the Daily Caller News Foundation Wednesday.He continued, “Findings from this year’s Religious Freedom Index—that 62 percent of respondents said that faith had been important during the pandemic — align with Gallup’s findings on the importance of religious services to Americans’ mental health.”Religious organizations in New York most recently\\xa0took\\xa0Democratic New York Gov.

Twitter also froze the New York Post’s account for more than two weeks after the publication reported on Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop.Facebook took down multiple advertisements by the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life organization, and has censored similar content from other pro-life groups. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg admitted in 2019 there “clearly was bias” over the monitoring of pro-life content on the platform, Fox News reported.Google came under fire earlier this year after a command function bug revealed the company’s search engine effectively blacklisted an internally-generated list of conservative news outlets, Mediaite reported. Internal memos obtained by the Daily Caller in 2019 showed that the search engine previously used an “XPA news blacklist” tool to single out conservative content.Lee also issued a statement of support Thursday for the Online Content Policy Modernization Act (S.4632) — introduced by Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham — after consideration of the legislation was postponed.WATCH:Graham’s bill would reform Section 230 so that online platforms could be held liable for moderating certain types of content. Such an overhaul of tech liability protections would almost certainly force companies to change their moderation practices, according to Politico. (RELATED: Trump Accuses Republicans Of Getting ‘Cold Feet’ On Abolishing Section 230)“Facebook and Twitter have claimed political neutrality while practicing political partisanship for far too long. That is why I would have voted for Senator Graham’s legislation to move through the Committee,” Lee said in a statement. “He has worked with me to iron out some issues in his bill, and I trust he will continue to work with me to iron out a few others in the coming Congress.”Republicans have taken a growing interest in overhauling Section 230. Trump even called for Section 230 to be “immediately terminated” in a Nov. 26 tweet and has said he will veto the annual defense budget if it does not include language abolishing the legal statute.For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!— Donald J.

Markwayne Mullin introduced legislation that would clarify Title IX protections for female athletes as based on biological sex, a press release said Thursday.The “Protect Women’s Sports Act” recognizes the different abilities conferred by biological sex, the statement says. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal funding.“Title IX was a historic provision championed by Hawaii’s own Congresswoman Patsy Mink in order to provide equal opportunity for women and girls in high school and college sports,” Gabbard said in the statement. “It led to a generational shift that impacted countless women, creating life-changing opportunities for girls and women that never existed before.”NORTH CHARLESTON, SC – OCTOBER 05: Democratic presidential candidate, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) addresses the crowd at the Blue Jamboree on October 5, 2019 in North Charleston, South Carolina. Six of the 2020 Democratic candidates were scheduled to attend the event. (Photo by Brian Blanco/Getty Images)“However, Title IX is being weakened by some states who are misinterpreting Title IX, creating uncertainty, undue hardship and lost opportunities for female athletes. Our legislation protects Title IX’s original intent which was based on the general biological distinction between men and women athletes based on sex,”The Supreme Court determined in June that discrimination on the basis of gender identity also constitutes sex discrimination within the meaning of VII of the Civil Rights Act. Weeks prior, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights decided in a complaint involving Connecticut high school sports that permitting transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports violates the civil rights of female athletes.Twenty-eight Congressional Democrats signed a letter in June condemning the Department of Education for its ruling, accusing the department of discrimination “against transgender youth” by restricting women’s sports to biological females.“Title IX was designed to give women and girls an equal chance to succeed, including in sports,” Mullin said. “Allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports diminishes that equality and takes away from the original intent of Title IX.” (RELATED: Connecticut Policy Allowing Transgender Athletes In Sports Found To Violate Female Civil Rights)WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 14: Rep.

I am proud to lead this bill that will safeguard the integrity of women’s sports and ensure female athletes can compete fairly,” he continued.Attorney General William Barr became involved in the Connecticut lawsuit in March, when he signed a statement of interest arguing the policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in high school sports “deprives those women of the single-sex athletic competitions that are one of the marquee accomplishments of Title IX.”“It is critical that the legacy of Title IX continues to ensure women and girls in sports have the opportunity to compete and excel on a level playing field,” Gabbard said in the statement.'},\n",

       "  'full_article_text': 'Chinese tech giant Huawei is still a threat to U.S. national security, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) held in a unanimous, bipartisan vote Thursday.Huawei had sought to appeal the FCC’s June order designating the company as a threat, but the FCC’s 5-member board voted down the request. Huawei is among China’s largest tech companies and is at the forefront of the nation’s effort to build other nations’ 5G networks.The FCC’s June order also applied to the Chinese company ZTE, though it does not appear to have appealed the ruling.

The United Kingdom contracted Huawei to build parts of its own 5G system in 2019, leading the U.S. to warn that doing so would limit the intelligence the U.S. would be willing to share with its closest ally.The U.K. reconsidered its contract in July, banning all Huawei equipment from its 5G network.“By the time of the next election, we will have implemented in law an irreversible path for the complete removal of Huawei equipment from our 5G networks,” U.K. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said at the time. “Given the uncertainty…around Huawei’s supply chain, the U.K. can no longer be confident it will be able to guarantee the security of future Huawei 5G equipment.”Like all Chinese companies, Huawei and ZTE have close ties to the Chinese Communist Party, making any dealings with them questionable. Within the past four years alone, the CCP has ended democracy in Hong Kong and imprisoned millions of Uighur Muslims in concentration camps in Xinjiang.'},\n",

Chuck Grassley blasted Democrats and the “liberal media” in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, saying that both groups ignored his committee’s report regarding suspicious Hunter Biden’s business dealings, aspects of which were seemingly validated on Wednesday when the president-elect’s son confirmed that he is under federal investigation.“We showed our work and made our findings public, but the liberal media and Democrats chose to dismiss it. They even falsely claimed our work was Russian disinformation in order to protect the Bidens,” Grassley said in his speech.He was referring to an investigation conducted by the Senate Finance and Senate Homeland Security Committees into Hunter Biden’s business activities in Ukraine and China. (RELATED: Hunter Biden’s Foreign Business Dealings Created ‘Extortion And Counterintelligence Concerns,’ Senate Report Says)On Wednesday, Hunter Biden released a statement through his father’s presidential transition team saying that he was notified this week that he is the target of an investigation led by the U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware. Biden said that his “tax affairs” are under investigation.A source familiar with the probe told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the investigation began in 2018, well before Joe Biden started his presidential campaign and before the Senate investigations of Hunter Biden.Grassley, who chairs the Finance Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security panel, released a report on Sept. 23 that showed Biden received millions of dollars in wire transfers from foreign companies that U.S. authorities flagged for possible criminal activity.The report showed that Biden and his business partners used a complex system of holding companies, shell companies and law firms for consulting deals with companies in Ukraine and China, as well as with a Russian billionaire named Elena Baturina.Republicans said their findings raised “criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns” regarding Biden’s business dealings.The report received little media attention beyond coverage in conservative outlets.Politico ran a story about the report with the headline, “GOP senators’ anti-Biden report repackages old claims.”“Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley’s interim report largely relies on previously known information,” the sub-headline of the story reads.Most major media outlets censored coverage of another development in the Hunter Biden saga. Outlets like CNN and NPR made editorial decisions not to cover aspects of a story first reported by The New York Post on Oct. 14 regarding emails from a laptop that purportedly belonged to Biden.NPR announced on Oct. 22 that it would not report about Biden’s laptop, saying that the organization did not “want to waste the listeners’ and readers’ time on stories that are just pure distractions.”CNN’s political director, David Chailian, told employees during a conference call held the day of the Post report that the network would not be covering the Biden laptop story.“Obviously, we’re not going with the New York Post story right now on Hunter Biden,” Chalian said during the conference call, which was recorded by the activist group Project Veritas.Grassley and Johnson did not rely on information from the Biden laptop for their investigation, but many of the emails on the computer involved many of the business activities discussed in the Senate report.Prominent Democrats also accused Grassley and Johnson earlier this year of promoting Russian disinformation about Hunter Biden’s business activities in order to undermine his father’s political campaign.“Those same liberal outlets that disparaged our investigation now report that Hunter Biden’s financial deals in China raised counterintelligence concerns,” Grassley said.CNN reported on Wednesday that the Justice Department is scrutinizing Hunter Biden’s taxes and investigating him for possible money laundering related to business deals with Chinese companies.One area of focus is Biden’s partnership with CEFC China Energy, a major energy conglomerate whose chairman had ties to the People’s Liberation Army.CEFC wired $5 million to a firm linked to Hunter Biden beginning in August 2017. According to Grassley and Johnson’s report, U.S. regulators flagged some of the wire payments for possible criminal activity.CEFC also paid the younger Biden $1 million for legal services for Patrick Ho, an executive at CEFC who was convicted in the U.S. for bribing African politicians to win mining contracts.“It’s outrageous that the Fourth Estate would choose to ignore facts when they are uncovered by Republicans.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

I know somewhere Bill Clinton is probably kicking himself saying ‘why didn’t I think of that when people started asking about my romantic follies,’” Gaetz told “Fox & Friends.”U.S. intelligence officials say that Christine Fang, an alleged Chinese spy also known as Fang Fang, infiltrated the offices of multiple politicians in the San Francisco area — including Swalwell, Axios reported Monday night. Democratic California Rep. Swalwell has refused to discuss\\xa0whether his relationship with Fang was purely professional or not. His office has responded to media queries that the issue is “classified.”Swalwell said Wednesday, “They are not going to silence me,” and suggested he did nothing wrong while he was involved with Fang.Gaetz also noted during his Fox interview “that Democrats are newly frustrated with leaks from the FBI and the Department of Justice. I don’t really remember their outrage when [former National Security Advisor] Gen. Michael Flynn was being smeared with these leaks that were false saying that he was somehow improperly engaging with Russia when, in fact, general Flynn was saying that we needed to focus on China.” (RELATED: ‘Pee Tape Truther’ Eric Swalwell Was ‘The Pot Calling The Kettle Black’ Over Relationship With Alleged Chinese Spy)“But when Eric Swalwell engages in a very close relationship with clearly an agent of communist China, well that’s deemed as something we can just accept and move on. My suspicion is you’ll continue to hear Republicans very critical.”Gaetz joked that “Eric Swalwell is here to help. In fact, he wants to help so much in confronting China that he spent years super spreading the lies of the Russia hoax.” He added that Swalwell could have used his energies and position as a member of the House Intelligence Committee to investigate the threat from China.“Instead, he purposefully distracted the country and he hurt our national security as a consequence.”Gaetz agreed that the media response to the Swalwell story has been extremely limited and speculated what their reaction would be if he, Gaetz, was the congressman involved with an alleged Chinese spy.“If I was dating a waitress at a Chinese restaurant they would be burning a hole through my front door with the mainstream media’s you know, lights and cameras.” (RELATED: Tucker Carlson: ‘Eric Swalwell … Used His Office To Promote Beijing’s Talking Points’ While Sitting On The House Intelligence Committee)Democratic presidential candidate Rep.

When Republicans are targeted they get impeachment’s, investigations and threats of jail time. So it really is a double standard.”'},\n",

We do that, next guy comes along and says, well, guess what? By executive order, I guess everybody can have machine guns again. So we’ve got to be careful.”Progressives like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have urged Biden to use executive authority on numerous other issues, including civil rights protections, student debt cancellation, raising the national minimum wage and prioritizing the climate and clean energy.Republicans currently hold a two-seat majority in the Senate.

We appreciate that,” Johnson said in a CBSN interview Wednesday. “Now our question is, how do we ensure a successful outcome? The racial equity adviser to the president could hold the portfolio and oversee the process.”WATCH:Johnson said a White House racial equity adviser could function like corporate America’s diversity and inclusion officers, who often have executive-level status. He told CBSN that many companies have successfully championed diversity among their consumer base through the use of executive officers who can hold the company accountable.“It’s the right style [of] business practice, it should be the sound practice of our governance to make sure we celebrate our diversity, build on our diversity and look toward the opportunities of the future,” Johnson said.National Urban League CEO Marc Morial and National Action Network leader Reverend Al Sharpton were also in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting with Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The group discussed topics ranging from voting rights to expanding the diversity of Biden’s upcoming administration, according to CBS News.“Their job is to push me,” Biden said of his planned meeting with civil rights leaders in a Dec. 3 interview with CNN host Jake Tapper. “My job is to keep my commitment and make the decisions.” Biden also told Tapper he was committed to building the most diverse Cabinet in American history.Civil rights leaders spoke positively of their meeting with Biden and Harris but reiterated that their support would be contingent on the upcoming administration’s policies, ABC News reported. (RELATED: ‘Expansive Power’: Here’s Who Progressives Want To See In Joe Biden’s Cabinet)Civil rights leaders are closely watching who Biden picks for attorney general given the power of the Department of Justice (DOJ) over issues like racial justice and voting rights, CBS News reported. “My preference, I said to him, is to have a Black attorney general,” Sharpton told reporters after the meeting.“This is someone who needs to walk into the door of the job, who knows immediately what to do — the power and authority of the DOJ — and depoliticize how the department has been politicized over the last four years,” Johnson told CBSN regarding the attorney general nomination.'},\n",

Hill is running against U.S. Rep. Steve Knight (R-CA). Democrats are targeting at least six congressional seats in California, currently held by Republicans, where Hillary Clinton received more votes in the 2016 presidential election. These districts have become the centerpiece of their strategy to flip the House and represent nearly one-third of the 23 seats needed for the Democrats to take control of the chamber in the November 6 midterm elections.

CNN reported that the probe centers on Biden’s business dealings in China.The Biden transition team issued a statement saying that the president-elect “is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.”Hunter Biden has come under scrutiny over his foreign business dealings, including in China and Ukraine.The Daily Caller News Foundation reported last year that the IRS placed a $112,000 tax lien against Biden’s property in 2015 over unpaid taxes.Vice-President Joe Biden and sons Hunter Biden (L) and Beau Biden walk in the Inaugural Parade January 20, 2009 in Washington, DC.

The Senate report said that CEFC wired Biden’s law firm $5 million from August 2017 to August 2018. Biden also represented Patrick Ho, an executive for CEFC who was arrested in 2017 on charges that he bribed African government officials on behalf of the Chinese company.Federal investigators obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant against Ho, according to court documents released in his case.The owner of a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware, released documents in October that he claimed were from a laptop that Biden dropped off at his store in April 2019. A copy of the laptop’s hard drive includes thousands of Biden’s personal and business emails.The shop owner, John Paul Mac Isaac, told media outlets that he provided the Biden laptop to the FBI and U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware in December 2019. He provided a copy of the hardware with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in September 2020.A former business partner of Biden’s named Tony Bobulinski also released a trove of emails and text messages he exchanged with Biden in 2017 as they were pursuing a deal with CEFC.Some of the messages showed that Hunter Biden arranged a meeting with his father and Bobulinski in May 2017. Bobulinski said in interviews in October that he and the Bidens discussed business deals in China, undercutting the president-elect’s claims that he has not discussed business with his son.Bobulinski said in interviews that FBI agents interviewed him in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 29 regarding Hunter Biden and the prospective deal with CEFC.The U.S. attorney’s office in Delaware declined comment.“We cannot comment on an ongoing investigation,” said spokeswoman Kim Reeves.Biden’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.Editor’s note: This post has been updated.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Dick Durbin, it almost feels like they are running a victory lap on the backs of people they’ve broken asunder by this crisis. It’s not callous, it’s sadistic.”“Does Nancy Pelosi feel all tingly on the inside knowing that she basically turned her back on the American people, but she won a victory over Donald Trump for her own political greed and gain because she withheld money from those very people who need it?” McDowell continued. “You know the Democrats are supposed to be the party for the working man and woman, it turns out it might be the party of sociopaths.”McDowell went on to say that she predicted in October that Democrats would delay aid until after the election in the hopes that afterward they would have more power to leverage over Republicans.“I’m not going to turn around on you, but why does Nancy Pelosi have a job?” she asked.Perino concluded by noting that moderate Democrats had reportedly tried to warn Pelosi that a failure to pass coronavirus aid before the election could hurt them.'},\n",

(RELATED: Coronavirus Vaccine Will Not Be Mandatory, Joe Biden Says)“While steps have been taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19, epidemiologists and public health experts have concluded that a vaccine will be necessary to develop herd immunity and ultimately stop the spread of the disease.”“The State must make efforts to promote vaccination and ensure that a high enough percentage of the population is vaccinated against COVID-19 to develop sufficient immunity. If public health officials determine that sufficient immunity has not been developed, this legislation will allow the Department of Health to require vaccination.”The bill does not define what constitutes as sufficient immunity. It is also unclear how the mandate would be enforced. Rosenthal did not respond to the Daily Caller’s request for comment at the time of publication.A recent union poll conducted by the Uniformed Firefighters Association (UFA) found that roughly 55% of New York City firefighters polled would not take a COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to first responders, according to the New York Post.UFA President Andy Ansbro said while he plans on getting vaccinated, some are choosing to opt out.“A lot of them probably feel they are not in a risk category, they are younger, stronger, they may have already had it and gotten through it, and feel it’s not their problem,” Ansbro said, according to the report. “They are more familiar with the coronavirus than they are with the vaccine.”Democratic Gov.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Poll results show that mental health improved for only one group of people during the coronavirus pandemic, and it’s a group that Democratic lawmakers repeatedly restricted.Gallup polled a little over a thousand Americans over the age of 18 from Nov. 5 – 19 and found that only those who attended religious services weekly saw a positive change between 2019 and 2020 in how they rated their mental health.In 2019, 42% of Americans who attended religious services weekly rated their mental health as excellent, the poll showed. In 2020, 46% of Americans who attended religious services weekly rated their mental health as excellent — a percentage increase of four points.No other Demographic group in the Gallup poll, which had a margin of error of ±4 percentage points and a confidence level of 95%, saw a percentage increase in rating their mental health as excellent. (RELATED: Supreme Court Ruling Sends A Message Churches Can’t Be Treated Like ‘Second Class’ Citizens, Legal Experts Say)34% of Americans say their mental health is excellent, down from 43% in 2019. https://t.co/kjobkuEEVD pic.twitter.com/U6mPW54ZSt— GallupNews (@GallupNews) December 8, 2020 “Houses of worship and religious services provide so much more than just a weekly meeting place — they are where so many Americans find strength, community, and meaning,” the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty’s Director of Research Caleb Lyman told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Findings from this year’s Religious Freedom Index—that 62 percent of respondents said that faith had been important during the pandemic — align with Gallup’s findings on the importance of religious services to Americans’ mental health.”The Gallup poll results are particularly striking in contrast to Democratic lawmakers’ restrictions on houses of worship. Governors and mayors across the United States have issued orders throughout the pandemic that restrict or prohibit religious services, and the Department of Justice has pushed back against such restrictions on multiple occasions.Governors like Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam banned gatherings of 10 or more people through initial stay-at-home orders, restrictions which effectively banned church services. Authorities\\xa0have arrested\\xa0multiple religious leaders for defying coronavirus orders, such as Pastor Tony Spell of the Louisiana Life Tabernacle church and Florida megachurch pastor Rodney Howard-Browne.Religious organizations in New York most recently took Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to the Supreme Court over his restrictions on houses of worship, accusing Cuomo of “targeting Orthodox practices.”Conservative justices, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, sided with religious organizations in the 5-4 ruling the night before Thanksgiving, while Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal justices. (RELATED: California’s Reopening Plan Discriminates Against Churches, DOJ Says)The majority said that Cuomo’s coronavirus restrictions on religious communities are “far more restrictive than any Covid-related regulations that have previously come before the Court, much tighter than those adopted by many other jurisdictions hard hit by the pandemic, and far more severe than has been shown to be required to prevent the spread of the virus.”“New York’s restrictions on houses of worship not only are severe, but also are discriminatory,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his concurring opinion.“In light of the devastating pandemic, I do not doubt the State’s authority to impose tailored restrictions—even very strict restrictions—on attendance at religious services and secular gatherings alike,” Kavanaugh continued. “But the New York restrictions on houses of worship are not tailored to the circumstances given the First Amendment interests at stake.”Cuomo’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.Earlier this year, the court sided 5-4 in favor of the liberal justices on COVID-19 religious restrictions in California and Nevada,\\xa0according to CNN.\\xa0(RELATED: ‘Religious Institutions Have Been A Problem’: Andrew Cuomo Threatens To Shut Down Churches, Synagogues)The DOJ has fought back against many of these restrictions. Attorney General William Barr set the tone for the DOJ’s attitude towards religious freedom during the pandemic by warning in an early April statement\\xa0that “even in times of emergency,” federal law prohibits religious discrimination.“Religion and religious worship continue to be central to the lives of millions of Americans,” Barr said. “This is true more so than ever during this difficult time.”“Government may not impose special restrictions on religious activity that do not also apply to similar nonreligious activity,” the attorney general added. “For example, if a government allows movie theaters, restaurants, concert halls, and other comparable places of assembly to remain open and unrestricted, it may not order houses of worship to close, limit their congregation size, or otherwise impede religious gatherings.”Barr also promised that the DOJ would be watching for any state or local government that “singles out, targets, or discriminates against any house of worship for special restrictions.”Since this statement was issued, the DOJ has intervened in multiple\\xa0cases\\xa0of government crackdowns on\\xa0churches\\xa0and pastors, specifically in Nevada, California, Oklahoma, Illinois, Virginia, and Mississippi.The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation for this story.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Swalwell has refused to discuss\\xa0whether his relationship with Fang was purely professional or not.Fang reportedly also compromised two Midwest mayors during her time in the U.S., including having a sexual encounter with an Ohio mayor in the backseat of a car.Swalwell told CNN that he “was shocked” when the FBI informed him that they believed Fang was engaged in espionage but said that he then “offered to help and I did help and I was thanked by the FBI for my help and that person is no longer in the country,” he said, citing Fang, who has moved back to China.“And if this is a country where people who criticize the president are going to have law enforcement information weaponized against them, that’s not a country that any of us want to live in.”The congressman insisted that he couldn’t “talk too much about the details of the case” even as he said that he shared no classified information with Fang.

Pelosi said Friday she would accept a coronavirus stimulus package after months of stalled negotiations, however, she declined a $916 billion coronavirus relief proposal that was offered by Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and supported by President Trump.The relief proposal would have given $600 direct payment for individuals and $1,200 for couples, according to House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. McConnell ripped Pelosi for refusing the offer and other offers throughout the ongoing pandemic.“In September, we tried something else — a targeted effort to send hundreds of billions of dollars for the PPP, vaccine development, and other priorities. Every Democrat voted to block us from even debating it. And they did it a second time in October. Last week, after speaking with the Administration, I made yet another overture. The Democratic Leader said no thanks,” McConnell said in his floor speech.WATCH:\\xa0“And just yesterday, the Speaker and the Democratic Leader brushed off two different overtures in the space of about two hours! I suggested that both sides drop what seem to be the most controversial demand in the eyes of our counterparts. Democrats continue to oppose common-sense legal protections that university presidents have been begging for and Republicans see no need to send huge sums of money to state and local governments whose tax revenues have actually gone up,” McConnell said.Pelosi, who has\\xa0held out on a big deal for around six months, said at a Friday press conference that now that Joe Biden is President-elect, she is willing to do a smaller deal.

The legislation authorizes a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops and requires the renaming of military bases named after Confederate figures.Trump’s qualms with the bill, however, have little to do with the anything related to national defense. Instead, Trump has insisted that he would veto the bill if it did not terminate Section 230, which grants social media companies broad immunity from content published on their platforms.“I hope House Republicans will vote against the very weak National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which I will VETO,” Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon.Despite the president’s threat, multiple lawmakers touted the bill’s overwhelming, bipartisan passage.\\xa0(RELATED: Trump Reaffirms Threat To Veto 2021 Defense Bill Over Section 230)“Today the House sent a strong, bipartisan message to the American people: Our service members and national security are more important than politics,” said Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee.Our service members and our national security are more important than politics. By passing the #FY21NDAA conference report with a veto-proof majority, the House has proven to be capable of legislating and reaching compromise that results in good policy outcomes.— Rep. Adam Smith (@RepAdamSmith) December 9, 2020 His comments were echoed by Republican Rep. Paul Mitchell, who said that “Today’s bipartisan vote affirms the importance of the NDAA for our military personnel and national security.”Today’s bipartisan vote affirms the importance of the #NDAA for our military personnel and national security. I call on the Senate to pass this vital legislation as fast as possible and for President Trump to sign it into law for our nation, service members, and their families.— Rep. Paul Mitchell (@RepPaulMitchell) December 8, 2020 If the bill passes with at least 67 votes in the Senate, then Trump could likely face the first veto override of his presidency.Though some Republicans have said that they will work to override a possible Trump veto, including Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, others have spoken differently.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that he would not vote to override a veto, saying that “Section 230 needs to get done,” according to The New York Times.The bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to pass it overwhelmingly in the coming days.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We don’t even know if we’re going to be able to see that passed. Looking back, was it a mistake for Pelosi and Schumer to turn down $1.8 trillion?”“There was some exuberance involved because an election was coming, and they were both bidding one another and trying to find some common ground,” Durbin told Tapper. “They didn’t reach that point. But to return to those pre-election days and sentiments, political sentiments, is very difficult.”Pelosi last week made a similar admission, calling the fact that a “new president” was taking office “a total game-changer.” (RELATED: Trey Gowdy Blasts Pelosi For COVID-19 Relief Comment: ‘What She Just Said Makes Me Madder Than Hell’)“It’s for a shorter period of time, but that’s OK now, because we have a new president,” she said.'},\n",

(RELATED: Report: Professor Claims That China Has Long Had ‘Old Friends Who Are The Top Of America’s Core Inner Circle’)U.S. intelligence officials say that Christine Fang, an alleged Chinese spy, infiltrated the offices of multiple politicians in the San Francisco area — including Swalwell, Axios reported Monday night. Swalwell is refusing to discuss the extent of his relationship with Fang.Carlson noted that Swalwell was one of the Democrats in Congress who consistently claimed that President Donald Trump was an agent of Russia “The irony is overwhelming. It’s always those who have the most to hide who attack other people for the very things they’ve done — always. Even at the time he was saying it, it was obvious to us that something was very wrong with Eric Swalwell.”Carlson noted that when questioning former FBI Director James Comey about the wiles of foreign spies, Swalwell inquired whether “they use sex, a honey trap, if you will, to set up a compromise. Spoken like a man who knows that subject quite well.”The Fox News host noted that when Swalwell’s Russia collusion theory dried up, he “turned his energies to his first love, which is defending the government of China from all criticism,” which Carson said included branding people who identified the coronavirus as a Chinese virus as being racist and xenophobic.“Take those words and type them into Google and you will find analogs almost precisely to the word in Chinese state media. That’s what he was repeating.”Carlson also said that in 2013 Swalwell also embraced views and policies consistent with those of China when it came to Trump’s stance on North Korea and his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal.“In 2013, for example, he demanded that we, quote, ‘engage China and Russia to keep Iran nuclear free.’ Do you notice a pattern here? Of course you do,” said Carlson.

Lloyd Austin, who President-elect Joe Biden selected as his secretary of defense, was accused during the Obama administration of downplaying the threat posed by ISIS, allegations Austin vehemently denied at the time but could be a roadblock to his Senate confirmation.The allegations stem from Austin’s tenure as commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which directed U.S. military operations in the Middle East against the Islamic State.A Defense Department inspector general’s report released on Jan. 31, 2017, cited witnesses who claimed that Austin did not like to receive bad news about ISIS and that he painted a “rosier” picture of the fight against the terror group than was warranted. (RELATED: Joe Biden Picks Gen. Lloyd Austin As Pentagon Chief)“Several witnesses asserted that GEN Austin did not like to receive bad news from his staff regarding USCENTCOM’s counter-ISIL campaign. These witnesses believed that GEN Austin was the source of pressure to present a rosier picture of the effects of USCENTCOM’s operations against ISIL,” the report said.Austin, who retired from the military on March 30, 2016, emphatically denied allegations laid out in the IG report. Two officers who worked under Austin also disputed the claims in interviews with the IG.“GEN Austin denied the allegations, stating that he had no knowledge ‘of anybody trying to downplay or rosy up intelligence,'” the report said.Gen. Lloyd Austin III, commander of U.S. Central Command, prepares to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill September 16, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)“You’re not going to win if you don’t have the right information. So rosying up that doesn’t help us be successful in this fight,” Austin told Pentagon investigators, according to the IG report.Austin, 67, also allegedly downplayed the ISIS threat in briefings to the Obama White House. According to a 2016 Atlantic story, Obama administration officials said Austin told the White House that ISIS was “a flash in the pan.”Austin’s comments to President Barack Obama shaped the president’s now-infamous comment that ISIS was akin to a “jayvee” basketball team, the officials told The Atlantic at the time.ISIS expanded aggressively in the months after Obama’s remarks, taking control of vast swaths of Syria and Iraq, while building an online network of sympathizers around the globe.A spokesman for Austin told The Atlantic at the time that “at no time” did Austin “ever consider ISIL a ‘flash in the pan’ phenomenon.”The IG report also cited an unidentified witness who said that Austin remarked at a commander’s conference held in Qatar from Oct. 22-24, 2014, that while he was confident the U.S. would “win this fight” against ISIS, “we have to manage the narrative.”Notes taken by CENTCOM’s historian reflect that Austin “emphasized the importance of keeping the narrative in the right place as the narrative on the counter-ISIL campaign was beginning to spin out of control.”The IG ultimately found no evidence that military leaders, including Austin, fabricated or distorted intelligence regarding ISIS.Austin could face an uphill battle in his Senate confirmation for reasons other than his views on ISIS.Several Democratic senators have said they oppose granting a waiver to bypass a law that requires secretaries of defense to have been out of service for at least seven years.The Senate voted overwhelmingly in 2017 to approve a waiver for James Matttis, who preceded Austin at CENTCOM, to serve as Trump’s defense secretary.The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment about Austin’s previous remarks.Biden defended Austin in an essay for The Atlantic published Tuesday. In the piece, Biden said that he and Obama “turned to Austin” for advice on confronting ISIS.“He designed and executed the campaign that ultimately beat back ISIS, helping to build a coalition of partners and allies from more than 70 countries who worked together to overcome a common enemy,” Biden wrote.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'A number of Democrats have questioned President-elect Joe Biden’s choice for defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, citing their concerns about selecting a recently retired general.Democrats in both the House and Senate, including Senate Armed Services Ranking Member Jack Reed, have not said they would vote in favor of Austin, saying the position is not for recently retired generals and instead for civilians. Retired generals require a congressional waiver to be appointed. News broke Monday night that Biden had chosen Austin to be his defense secretary, sparking several reactions from Democrats to the decision.Reed was asked Tuesday about a waiver for Austin, to which he said, “I think the burden of proof is on the administration and it also comes down ultimately to the quality of the nominee. General Austin is an outstanding officer… I think he should have an opportunity to talk about his vision for the Department of Defense and that I think is the decisive factor.”“But it’s still I think, I think the preference would be for someone who is not recently retired,” Reed added.Democratic Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, also questioned Biden’s choice, sending a number of tweets Tuesday saying although she likes Austin, she believes the position is designated for a civilian.Gen.

We worked together when he commanded U.S. forces in Iraq, when he was vice chief of the Army, and when he was the CENTCOM commander,”\\xa0Slotkin\\xa0said. “But choosing another recently retired general to serve in a role designed for a civilian just feels off.”“The job of secretary of defense is purpose-built to ensure civilian oversight of the military. That is why it requires a waiver from the House and Senate to put a recently retired military officer in the job,” she continued. (RELATED: ‘Just Feels Off’: Democrat On Armed Services Committee Questions Biden’s Pick For Defense Secretary)Democratic Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, also shared his concerns about Austin for the position, saying Tuesday, “I have the deepest respect and administration for General Austin and this nomination, and this nomination is exciting and historic. But I believe that a waiver of the seven-year rule would contravene the basic principle that there should be civilian control over a nonpolitical military.”“That principle is essential to our democracy. That’s the reason for the statute which I think has to be applied, unfortunately, in this instance,” he continued. “I will not support the waiver.”Democratic Montana Sen. Jon Tester said he does not think he will vote to support a waiver for Austin, saying he did not vote in favor of the waiver for former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. (RELATED: Senate Democrats Hint At Opposing Waiver For Biden’s Secretary Of Defense Nominee)“I didn’t for Mattis and I don’t think I will for him,” Tester said, referring to Austin, according to The Hill. “I love Mattis, I thought Mattis was a great secretary. And I think this guy is gonna be a great secretary of defense. I just think that we ought to look at the rules,” Tester continued.A defense secretary must be retired from active service for at least seven years before assuming the position, which is a civilian role, unless granted a waiver by both the House and Senate, according to federal law.

But President Donald Trump is quietly locking in policy land mines that would almost certainly clash with President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda, according to U.S. News & World Report.“President Trump has rolled back government regulations, streamlined project approvals, brought much-needed agency accountability, is bringing our troops home, and changed the way domestic and international deal-making is done so that the results help hardworking Americans, not the Washington elite,” said deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere.President Donald Trump arrives for the Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Summit on December 8, 2020 (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)White House aides said the administration expects to continue reshaping federal policies despite the expected handoff to the incoming Biden administration, according to The Washington Post. A number of these moves could be difficult for Biden to overturn or challenge.The administration implemented sweeping changes earlier this month to the citizenship test immigrants must take to become American citizens. Critics argued that adding more complex questions and a higher threshold to pass intentionally make the test difficult for immigrants, particularly from non-English speaking countries, The New York Times reported.The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute calculated that the Trump administration has implemented more than 400 changes to the immigration system. The administration is continuing to push through changes in its final weeks, including efforts to limit asylum protections.Biden pledged to reverse his predecessor’s immigration policies but bureaucratic realities reflect the major roadblocks he would face in fulfilling such a pledge, according to Politico. Immigration experts have argued it could take years for a Biden administration to rollback Trump-era immigration reforms, USA Today reported.A U.S. flag flies near the U.S.-Mexico border (David McNew/Getty Images)Trump has also moved quickly to cement his legacy in foreign and defense policy. After firing Defense Secretary Mark Esper shortly after the election, the president announced a reduction of U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan from 5,000 to 2,500. (RELATED: Ending ‘Endless Wars’ Could Cement Trump’s Foreign Policy Legacy)Under the direction of acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, the administration is moving to cut U.S. troops in Iraq from 3,000 to 2,500. Trump also ordered the withdrawal of most of the 700 U.S. troops currently stationed in Somalia earlier this month.State Department and Treasury Department sanctions against nations like Iran and China have grown since the election and are likely to be expanded upon until the end of Trump’s term in office, according to The Washington Post.“I still have an obligation every hour, every minute, to defend the American people and to keep them foremost in our efforts,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a Nov. 22 interview with Saudi news outlet Al-Arabiya. “We’ll do that to the very last minute.”The Trump administration has been placing land mines in one crucial policy area where Trump and Biden diverge significantly: energy and the climate.Interior Department officials announced in a Dec. 7 statement that the Bureau of Land Management will auction off drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by early January. The move could set up a legal showdown between the Trump administration and environmental groups shortly before Biden takes office, according to NPR.The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Getty Images)Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency are also moving to finalize major rules in the weeks leading up to Biden’s inauguration. Two of the proposed changes would raise the standard of enacting new public health protections, according to The Washington Post.Biden has vowed to reverse Trump-era actions on energy and climate policy. But a Columbia University climate report found that Trump has authorized more than 100 climate deregulation actions. Rolling back those changes, along with last-minute reforms, would almost certainly create headaches for a Biden administration.Trump has been notably silent on his administration’s recent actions. The president’s public appearances have been moot on policy matters and are largely overshadowed by his campaign’s legal challenges contesting the election results. (RELATED: Trump Legal Challenge ‘Is Winding Down’)“You’re not seeing the rhetoric coming from the president since the end of the election,” American Immigration Council policy counsel Aaron Reichlin-Melnick told The Washington Post. “But the administration itself is moving forward and accelerating its efforts to get these midnight regulations out the door.”'},\n",

Carson and Dennis say the Obama administration left the CFO post vacant for years at a time, leaving the department’s finances in “shambles” and its tech outdated when President Donald Trump’s administration took over.The report highlights the department’s improved systems for tracking where grant money is going and how it is being spent. HUD has now compiled more than 20 years of grant data on the city, state and congressional district levels into a database officials can consult from their phones. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Admin Moves To Allow Single-Sex Homeless Shelters To Admit Based On Biological Sex)Dennis told the Caller that HUD owed Congress 250 financial statements when he took office in early 2018, and that total has now been reduced to “single digits.”“Efficiency, that’s the one-word response,” Carson said when asked about the changes to HUD.The Department of Housing and Urban Development building is seen in Washington, DC, in July 2019. (Alastair Pike/AFP via Getty Images)The department’s renewed focus on finances began in 2018 when Dennis, along with Carson, established new integrity task force to cut down on wasteful spending. HUD established the task force following widely publicized reports of the department ordering a $31,000 dining set for Carson’s office. While Carson canceled the order and an inspector general (IG) report cleared him of misconduct at the time, the IG also said the incident indicated a “systemic failure” in finance reports.The 2018 CFO report told the same story, identifying 15 areas in which HUD was weak or deficient in complying with regulations. The 2020 report, which received an unqualified opinion from the IG, said the department has reduced those to just one.Dennis argued the late financial reports and inefficient systems came largely thanks to Obama leaving the CFO position vacant for eight years, a claim that conflicts with records of Obama’s HUD. News reports show Obama’s CFO Brad Huther died in office in 2015, leaving less than two years of vacancy prior to Trump taking office.“Huther briefly held the position but he passed away in less than a year. So from 2011 it was essentially vacant,” a HUD official clarified to the Caller. “That was where the 8 years number came from.”Records show Huther’s predecessor, Douglas Criscitello, left the Obama administration in 2011 and Huther didn’t take office until 2014.“It wasn’t considered an important area,” Carson said of the department’s finances under Obama.Carson also urged President-elect Joe Biden to maintain the current course once he takes office. While\\xa0 Trump has yet to concede the election, he has authorized his administration to begin the transition process. The Electoral College will officially vote to certify Biden’s win Dec. 14, at which point Trump has said he will be willing to leave the White House.“I don’t see why those conversations won’t continue when the Biden administration comes to be, if the Biden administration comes to be,” Carson said. “Hopefully they will recognize the efficiency we’ve achieved, and if they don’t continue to build on that, they’re going to run into problems.”'},\n",

The suit alleges the states failed to segregate ballots that would allow an “accurate analysis to determine which ballots were cast in conformity with the legislatively set rules and which were not.”Under the guise that Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar would order county officials to segregate the ballots received late, the Supreme Court refused to expedite Pennsylvania Republicans’ challenge to a state Supreme Court order that allowed ballots received up to three days after the election to be counted as valid even if they lacked a postmark in October.Boockvar originally complied, issuing guidance on Oct. 28 ordering all ballots received after Nov. 3 to be kept separate in case the Supreme Court ruled the extension unconstitutional.Boockvar updated the guidance last minute on Nov. 1, ordering all ballots that arrived before Nov. 6 to be counted.Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito ordered on Nov. 6 that all late ballots must be segregated despite Boockvar’s guidance.Georgia Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs dismissed the allegations, according to The Texas Tribune. (RELATED: Arizona GOP Encourages Constituents To Give Their ‘Lives’ Over Trump’s Election Dispute)“The allegations in the lawsuit are false and irresponsible,” Fuchs said. “Texas alleges that there are 80,000 forged signatures on absentee ballots in Georgia, but they don’t bring forward a single person who this happened to. That’s because it didn’t happen.”Georgia Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs on the Texas lawsuit: “The allegations in the lawsuit are false and irresponsible … they don’t bring forward a single person who this happened to. That’s because it didn’t happen.”— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) December 8, 2020Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the suit a “publicity stunt.”.@MIAttyGen @dananessel issued the following statement in response to the lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton seeking to overturn election results in Michigan and other states: pic.twitter.com/62Y4SLpiis— Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (@MIAttyGen) December 8, 2020“The motion filed by the Texas Attorney General is a publicity stunt, not a serious legal pleading.

They’re working. We need to raise an additional $67,000 to ensure over 40 of these go up across Georgia. Help us get this done. https://t.co/PSGDiRRAg0— ReallyAmerican.com ????????

He also asserted that clemency for Flynn did not indicate that he was innocent of charges in his criminal case.

General Michael Flynn (R) at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, where he is holding meetings on December 21, 2016. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)“President Trump’s decision to pardon Mr. Flynn is a political decision, not a legal one. Because the law recognizes the President’s political power to pardon, the appropriate course is to dismiss this case as moot,” Sullivan wrote.Sullivan quoted a ruling in another case to say that the pardon does not by itself “render [Flynn] innocent of the alleged violation.”Trump issued a broad pardon for Flynn on Nov. 25, saying that he was wrongfully targeted in the special counsel’s investigation.In the pardon order, Trump said that Flynn could not face criminal liability for any crimes investigated by the special counsel’s office, or grand juries in Washington, D.C. and Virginia. The order seemingly protects Flynn from prosecution for lobbying work he did in 2016 for the Turkish government.Flynn pleaded guilty on Dec. 1, 2017 to making false statements to the FBI on Jan. 24, 2017, regarding conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S.After reaffirming his guilty plea on Dec. 18, 2018, Flynn began the process of withdrawing from his plea agreement.On Jan. 29, 2020, Flynn filed a declaration saying that he did not intentionally lie to the FBI and that he regretted entering a plea agreement with the special counsel’s team.Attorney General William Barr appointed a U.S. attorney to review the Justice Department and FBI investigation of Flynn. The prosecutor, Jeffrey Jensen, discovered numerous FBI documents that provided insight into the bureau’s investigation of Flynn.One document showed that the FBI planned to close a counterintelligence investigation against Flynn on Jan. 4, 2017. The FBI opened an investigation against Flynn and other Trump campaign advisers in August 2016 as part of Crossfire Hurricane.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: ‘He’ll Be Living With Macho Man In Cell Block 11’: Joy Behar Predicts Trump Will Land In Prison)WATCH:Cohost Sara Haines began the segment by asking whether President Trump could, if he so chose, preemptively pardon himself. “Can he even do that based on your legal expertise?” she asked.James said that her understanding was that Trump could preemptively issue pardons to others, but the only way to pardon himself would be to step down and allow Vice President Mike Pence to assume the presidency, at which point he could issue a pardon to Trump.“I suspect he’ll pardon his family members, his children, his son-in-law and individuals in his administration as well as some of his close associates,” James continued, noting that she did expect him at some point to step down so that Pence could pardon him as well.“It’s important to understand he’s pardoned from federal crimes. He is not pardoned from state crimes,” James added. “Last year I introduced a bill in the state legislature which would close the pardon loophole so that individuals such as the President of the United States would not evade justice. It’s important we have this check on presidential powers and that the legislature —the\\xa0 state legislature, I’m so happy they passed that bill and it’s now the law in the state of New York. President Trump cannot avoid justice in the great state of New York.”“So, just to reiterate, there’s no way a potential pardon for Trump or his three eldest kids would shield them from anything you’re investigating?” Behar asked. “Am I right? That’s what you just said —”“Correct, but it’s important —” James clarified, “Joy, it’s important to understand my investigation is civil in nature. In the event we uncover any conduct or activities that would suggest criminal activities, then that would change obviously our investigation. It would change the posture of our investigation.”“And you also intend to prosecute him after he’s out of office, correct?” Behar pressed again.James pushed back, saying again that her office’s investigation was civil rather than criminal. “In the event that we uncover any activity or conduct —” she continued.Behar asked again, “But will you go ahead with the civil suits?”James confirmed that the civil suits would go forward whether Trump remained in the White House or not. “So after January 20th at 12:00 our investigation will continue, Joy,” she said.'},\n",

(RELATED: Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary Says ‘There’s No Science’ To Recent COVID Lockdown Rules)Kershner told Fox that as other businesses get shut down due to the pandemic, “it trickles over to us.”“Even as an essential business it’s very hard on us because of the impact to our customers. Our customers have been shutting down since March 20,” Kershner told the Daily Caller’s Jorge Ventura, noting his company only services small businesses. “As of late we’ve had just a lot of customers coming in and saying they have to leave the state.”I spoke to business owner Nick Kershner of Matchless IT in Long Beach who lockdown protests outside the home of L.A.

Social gatherings are limited to individuals from a single household. Meanwhile retailers like supermarkets can operate with only 20% customer capacity.Other business owners are thinking of fleeing the state following lockdowns that began in March and have reportedly crippled small business owners.“The pandemic was the last straw because they shuttered businesses that could stay open,” Lauren Prichard told ABC 7 in May when she was preparing to move to Florida. Her husband, Mike Prichard, who owned a film to digital transfer service, echoed her statement, saying COVID-19 restrictions have been “challenging” for businesses to navigate, according to the report.Celebrity chef Andrew Gruel, who owns Slapfish Seafood restaurants throughout the state, told the Daily Caller Friday that he was considering moving his business to Florida due to the lockdowns.Elon Musk also threatened to leave the state in May and head to Texas if state health officials wouldn’t allow Tesla to open.

The bill which is currently in deliberation will not include $1,200 payments to all Americans as the previous relief package would have, Fox reported.“Well you talked about that $1.8 trillion bill that the White House — Steve Mnuchin the Treasury Secretary — was working on with the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,” Tapper said. “The Democrats walked away from that bill.”To which Sanders responded, “That’s right.”Tapper continued, “because they wanted $2.2 trillion and they walked away from $1.8 trillion. Was that a mistake?”“That’s what I’m saying,” Sanders said. “That’s exactly what I’m saying. Here was a proposal much, much larger.

Without a plan, millions could lose unemployment benefits, paid sick leave and eviction protections. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told the Washington Post that nearly 25 relief programs could expire without congressional action. She warned that this could cause “widespread hardship.”“All the bad things we were worried would happen — but were successfully addressed in the first round of bills — could hit at once,” MacGuineas said. “It would be blatant neglect to allow all these things to expire.”New stimulus checks are not a part of the current relief proposal, which is being negotiated amid an increasing number of virus related cases and deaths. At least 283,800 people have died in the US due to COVID-19, according to data from the New York Times.A survey released in September by the Pew Research Center found that 1 in 4 Americans have had trouble paying bills since the beginning of the pandemic. Further, 25% of adults said “they or someone in their household lost their job.”Twelve million Americans, if programs expire, could lose unemployment benefits the day after Christmas.The American Psychological Association’s (APA) annual “Stress in America” report released in October found the coronavirus pandemic is having a profound effect on Americans’ mental health. The usual stressors have been exacerbated by COVID-19, the survey says. (RELATED: Pandemic Has Led To ‘National Mental Health Crisis,’ APA Survey Finds)“The unusual combination of these factors and the persistent drumbeat of a crisis that shows no sign of abating that is leading APA to sound the alarm: We are facing a national mental health crisis that could yield serious health and social consequences for years to come,” the report said.“There is no question: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the lives of all Americans, and it will continue to do so. It has disrupted work, education, health care, the economy and relationships, with some groups more negatively impacted than others, the report continued.”Americans’ latest assessment of their mental health is worse than it has been at any point in the last two decades. https://t.co/xqEnuha90A— GallupNews (@GallupNews) December 7, 2020A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August found 1 in 4 young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 seriously considered suicide in the last week of June. Moreover, the study found the same rate of increasing substance abuse among the same age group over the same period.“The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety disorder was approximately three times those reported in the second quarter of 2019 (25.5% versus 8.1%), and prevalence of depressive disorder was approximately four times that reported in the second quarter of 2019, according to the study.”The study’s authors noted, however, that differences in survey methods and possible “unknown biases” in survey design could impair a true comparison between the years.Gallup’s annual mental health survey found a nine point decrease in Americans’ own appraisal of their mental health compared to 2019 results. Since 2001, according to the poll, the number of respondents who believe they are in excellent mental health averaged between 81 to 89%. But in 2020, the number fell to 76%.Vaile Wright, clinical research director at the American Psychological Association, told the Washington Post that mental and physical health go hand-in-and questioned why mental health is not a bigger part of coronavirus treatment.“Why isn’t there a mental health leader on the coronavirus task force?” Wright said. “Our physical and mental health are completely intertwined, and we need to treat them that way.”'},\n",

We used to heavily rely on them,” Di said at the event, according to The Washington Times.Di asserted that Wall Street was unable to “control” Trump, which had a negative impact on China during its trade standoff with the U.S.“I’m going to drop a bomb,” Di continued, “we had people up there inside America’s core circle of power, we had our old friends.”“During the last three to four decades, we used the core circle inside America’s real power,” Di said.But Di asserted that U.S.-China relations would be on the mend under Biden because of his administration’s close ties to Wall Street.“Now with Biden winning the election, the traditional elites, political elites, the establishment, they have a very close relationship with the Wall Street,” Di said.Di gave a nod to his communist party pedigree during his Shanghai speech.He told a story of an event he helped arrange for Gua Weimin, a deputy director of the Chinese government’s foreign propaganda office, in 2015 in Washington, D.C. to promote a book written by Xi Jinping.Di and Weimin appeared at an event held at Politics & Prose, a popular independent bookstore in Washington. Weimin serves as deputy director of China’s State Council Information Office, which controls Beijing’s foreign propaganda efforts.Chinese state-controlled media outlet China Daily wrote about the event, saying that the turnout showed that Xi’s book was “proving a popular read” in the U.S.Di also suggested in his speech in Shanghai that the Chinese government supported Hunter Biden’s business deals in China.“You all heard that Trump said Biden’s son has securities companies all over the world. But who helped Biden’s son build his global companies?” Di said.“There are indeed buy-and-sell transactions involved in here. So I think at this particular time, it is of strategic and tactical value for us to show goodwill.”Hunter Biden had several business deals in China, including one with CEFC China Energy, a major energy conglomerate whose owner has links to the communist party. CEFC wired Biden millions of dollars in 2017, according to a Senate report released in September. (RELATED: Feds Obtained FISA Warrant Against Hunter Biden’s Chinese Business Partner)WATCH:\\xa0Di’s remarks have surfaced as top U.S. counterintelligence officials have heightened warnings about Beijing’s covert efforts to influence U.S. policy, both in Congress and the Biden administration.William Evanina, the top counterintelligence official at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, warned last week that U.S. officials have seen a spike in Chinese operatives trying to cozy up to Biden associates.“We’ve also seen an uptick, which was planned and we predicted, that China would now re-vector their influence campaigns to the new administration,” Evanina said at a cybersecurity forum.“And when I say that, that malign foreign influence, that diplomatic influence plus, or on steroids, we’re starting to see that now play across the country to not only the folks starting in the new administration, but those who are around those folks in the new administration.”Several of Biden’s incoming advisers have long called for stronger diplomatic ties to Beijing, and for viewing China as an ally instead of a competitor. One of Biden’s key advisers, Steve Ricchetti, played an integral role in helping the Clinton administration pass a bill in 2000 that established Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.Clinton tasked Ricchetti, his deputy chief of staff, with wrangling votes in Congress to support PNTR.Jake Sullivan, who Biden has tapped as his national security adviser, has criticized President Trump’s China policies and called for working more closely with Beijing. He appeared on Beijing-controlled news outlet CGTN in December 2017 to criticize Trump over his policy in Israel.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'Two of President-elect Joe Biden’s cabinet selections successfully lobbied the Clinton White House on behalf of a cocaine trafficker seeking early release from prison, according to a 2002 congressional report on the Clinton-era “Pardongate” scandal.The report, from the House Committee on Government Reform, detailed Xavier Becerra and Alejandro Mayorkas’s efforts to secure a presidential commutation for Carlos Vignali, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1994 for drug trafficking.Biden nominated Becerra to serve as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and Mayorkas to oversee the Department of Homeland Security. Becerra was a U.S. congressman in Los Angeles and Mayorkas was the U.S. attorney for the city when they sought reprieve for Vignali.The report from the House committee asserted that Mayorkas’s advocacy was “totally inappropriate” given his position as a federal prosecutor. The report also detailed evidence that Vignali’s father, Horacio Vignali, made a series of campaign contributions to Becerra, who currently serves as California’s attorney general.The Vignali family donated more than $11,000 to Becerra’s political action committee from 1998 to 2001 and nearly $6,000 to Becerra’s congressional and mayoral campaigns, the report said.The issue of presidential pardons is poised to come roaring back in the waning days of President Donald Trump’s administration. The president has already come under scrutiny for pardoning Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser.Trump is also reportedly weighing pardons for family members and other associates. (RELATED: Biden Pick For DHS Chief ‘Exerted Improper Influence’ To Help Rich Foreign Investors)Largely forgotten over the past two decades is the slew of pardons and commutations that President Bill Clinton issued before leaving the White House, a scandal which came to be known as “Pardongate.”Clinton commuted Vignali’s sentence on his last day in office, Jan. 20, 2001.Becerra and Mayorkas could face questions during their Senate confirmation hearings over their role in the Vignali clemency process, one of the more prominent cases that falls under the Pardongate umbrella.Mayorkas gave a conflicting account of his role seeking commutation for Vignali during a Senate confirmation hearing in 2013 to serve as deputy secretary of DHS.He said at the hearing that he advocated for Vignali after being contacted by the Clinton White House, but the House report cited an email from Mayorkas that said otherwise, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015.The House report cites an email that Mayorkas wrote to his staff in 2001 in which he said he “called the White House counsel’s office” regarding Vignali and conveyed support for a commutation. He also apologized for his role in the Vignali case.Alejandro Mayorkas, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, speaks in Miami Beach, Florida, June 8, 2015. REUTERS/Joe Skipper.Allegations of bribery also swirled around Vignali’s commutation, though neither Mayorkas nor Becerra were accused of any wrongdoing in that regard.According to the House report, Hillary Clinton’s younger brother, Hugh Rodham, was paid $204,200 for two months of work that involved contacting the White House in support of Vignali’s release from prison.Rodham received nearly all of his payment — $200,000 — on Jan. 24, 2001, days after Clinton left office. House investigators asserted that the timing of the payment indicates that Rodham’s payment “was contingent upon his success” in helping Vignali get out of jail.The House report also revealed that Rodham was paid $230,000 to secure a pardon for Glenn Braswell, the owner of an herbal supplement company who was under investigation for tax evasion.The House report on the Vignali case said that a “key element” in the campaign to free the convicted drug dealer was a series of letters from prominent Los Angeles-area politicians, including Becerra.Becerra submitted a letter to Clinton on Nov. 21, 2000, in which he recommended “a full evaluation of this case to determine if justice has been achieved in the case of Mr. Vignali.”“In the interest of redeeming the life of a young man, I respectfully urge you to weigh a few factors in Mr. Vignali’s favor,” Becerra wrote.The House report notes:\\xa0“A number of these letters contained misleading statements calculated to create the impression that Carlos Vignali was innocent.”Mayorkas’s advocacy for Vignali was also a “significant” factor in commuting the prison sentence, then-White House counsel Meredith Cabe told the House committee. She said Mayorkas’s support was influential because “very few prosecutors advocate clemency in any form.”Bruce Lindsey, a close Bill Clinton ally who served as deputy White House counsel, told the House committee that he changed his mind in favor of commutation for Vignali after hearing from Mayorkas. Mayorkas said he contacted Lindsey in January 2001 after Horacio Vignali asked him to do so.Becerra told the committee that he reached out to Mayorkas in early 1999, on behalf of Horacio Vignali, who he considered a longtime friend. Becerra also contacted Roger Adams, the U.S. pardon attorney, regarding Viganli’s case on Oct. 13, 1998, according to the House report.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra speaks at the second annual Women’s March in Los Angeles, California, U.S. January 20, 2018. REUTERS/Patrick T. Fallon.Mayorkas told the House committee that he contacted the federal prosecutor who handled Vignali’s case, Todd Jones, after Becerra’s outreach in order to obtain additional information about the case.The report said Jones told Mayorkas that Viganli was “bad news” and a “major player” in the drug trafficking world. He also warned Mayorkas, “don’t go there,” in terms of seeking clemency for Vignali.Mayorkas met with Horacio Vignali after speaking with Becerra and discussed presidential clemency for Carlos Vignali, according to the House investigation.“Over the next two years, Mayorkas would see Horacio Vignali at various community events and at several one-on-one meetings with Vignali,” the report said.Jones told House investigators that he was “troubled” by Mayorkas’s intervention in the Vignali case, saying that Mayorkas should “stay the hell away from it” since he was not involved in prosecuting Vignali.The House committee reprimanded Mayorkas for pursuing commutation despite warnings from Jones.“U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas provided critical support for the Vignali commutation that was inappropriate, given his position,” the report said. “Mayorkas supported the Vignali commutation despite his ignorance of the facts of the case and his knowledge that the prosecutors responsible for the Vignali case opposed clemency.”Becerra also directly lobbied White House staff to help Vignali, the report said.According to Clinton staffers, Becerra “peppered” the White House with phone calls advocating for Vignali.Clinton also pardoned Marc Rich, a billionaire businessman who had gone on the lam after being convicted of tax evasion.The George W. Bush Justice Department investigated Clinton’s pardon for Rich. The investigation revealed that Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic committees, the Clinton Foundation and the Senate campaign for Hillary Clinton.Mayorkas came under scrutiny during the Obama administration for his links to another Hillary Clinton brother, Tony Rodham.In 2015, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general released a report that said that Mayorkas had “exerted improper influence” when he was director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to help prominent Democrats gain approval to do business under the EB-5 visa program.The program granted green cards to foreign nationals who invest at least $500,000 to U.S. companies.The report said that Mayorkas intervened to help GreenTech Automotive, a company owned by Tony Rodham and Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Virginia governor, gain approval to the EB-5 program.The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They politicized wearing of masks.”Hostin went on to note that Giuliani, as he has been representing the president’s interests in lawsuits challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election, has traveled around the country. (RELATED: ‘All Part Of The Kraken Plan’: Rudy Giuliani Mocked After Testing Positive For Coronavirus)“We don’t know when he tested positive for COVID, but he obviously is now, you know, contagious and probably has been for a little while, and is hospitalized.

Heidi Heitkamp and Ohio Rep.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Though a Vilsack nomination could anger more liberal members of the Democratic party, his moderate politics could mean a relatively easy path to Senate confirmation, according to Politico. Additionally, if confirmed he would enter the post with a familiarity that could be critically important amid a surging pandemic and struggling economy, especially in rural areas.As USDA Secretary, Vilsack would likely play a central role in helping to rebuild the economy in rural parts of the country and ensure that those out of work still had access to nutrition and public health assistance.Progressives could object to his nomination, since they have voiced the need for the department to channel its resources into combating climate change, supporting sustainable farming and confronting racial inequities within the food system, Politico reported last month.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

She also noted that the allegations are based on unfounded theories. (RELATED: Armed Demonstrators Protest Election Results Outside Michigan Official’s Home)“This case represents well the phrase: ‘this ship has sailed,'” Parker wrote.“The closest Plaintiffs get to alleging that election machines and software changed votes for President Trump to Vice President Biden in Wayne County is an amalgamation of theories, conjecture, and speculating that such alterations were\\xa0possible,” she continued.Two Republicans on Wayne County’s elections board said they were coerced into certifying the election results after the Democratic vice chair allegedly said they would audit the Wayne County election results.President Donald Trump lost the state by 3 percent, roughly 154,000 votes. The Board of Canvassers certified the results Nov. 23, according to The Detroit News.The president mounted – and retracted – a legal challenge in Michigan to challenge the results. Trump campaign lawyer Rudy Giuliani withdrew the campaign’s lawsuit that sought to stop the state from certifying its election results after he said the campaign achieved the goal when Wayne County appeared likely to not certify the results. However, the board eventually certified the results.Other Republicans have also tried to challenge the results, with Republican State Sens.

This was the 2nd election lawsuit that involved Ward.Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Randall Warner said Dec. 4, as a result of the case, there is no evidence of election fraud, the Arizona Mirror reported. Based on a review of more than 1,600 Maricopa County ballots by lawyers and forensic analysts, only nine contained an error, according to Warner.“The duplication process for the presidential election was 99.45% accurate,” he said. “And there is no evidence that the inaccuracies were intentional or part of a fraudulent scheme. They were mistakes. And given both the small number of duplicate ballots and the low error rate, the evidence does not show any impact on the outcome.”In a separate lawsuit in Maricopa County, the state Republican Party asked for a hand recount of ballots by precinct, NBC reported. The GOP did not claim vote fraud in the suit, but challenged if the state’s audit met Arizona laws, according to NBC. There have been 7 election lawsuits filed in Arizona to date, which have not resulted in any wins for the GOP.Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers said Dec. 4 overturning the state’s election results would be a violation of voter’s will and state law.“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution or the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court even suggests that the Arizona Legislature could retroactively appoint different electors who would cast their ballots for 2 different candidates,” Bowers’ statement said.'},\n",

Jim Banks sent a letter Friday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slamming Democrats for wearing face masks with political campaigns and marijuana leaves on them while on the House floor, saying it is a violation of House rules.The Daily Caller first obtained the letter which Banks sent to Pelosi, calling out the Speaker pro tempore, Democratic Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, for wearing a mask with his campaign logo on it. Banks said it is in clear violation of House rules, as campaign pins and other official resources for campaigning are prohibited. Banks also called out Democratic Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer for wearing a mask with marijuana leaves on it.“I’m writing to you out of concern over the use of facemasks on the House floor that promote both personal political campaigns and the use of recreational drugs and that overall diminish the seriousness and decorum of the House floor. On December 3, 2020, the Speaker pro tempore, Rep. Henry Cuellar, wore a facemask that appeared to display his campaign logo while sitting in the Speakers’ chair,” Banks’ letter to Pelosi reads.“This is an obvious violation of the House’s prohibition on the use of official resources for campaign purposes. All members are disallowed from wearing campaign pins on the House floor, and this is no different. It also could be considered a violation of, H. Res. 5, which prohibits the use of Congressional broadcasts for partisan political purposes,” Banks continued.The Daily Caller contacted Banks about the letter, to which he responded by saying: “Over the past year, the standards of decorum on the House floor went out the window. That happened on Nancy Pelosi’s watch, and I don’t see her doing much to make things better in her party. Ripping up the president’s speech and cutting the number of workdays in half doesn’t exactly set a high bar.”READ THE LETTER HERE:Daily Caller Obtained Jim Banks Face Masks On House Floor Letter by Henry Rodgers on ScribdBanks went on to say in the letter that Blumenauer was breaking the House’s Code of Conduct, saying it affects the credibility of the House. (RELATED: ‘A New President And A Vaccine’: Pelosi Explains Why She Will Approve COVID-19 Relief Bill After Continued Delays)“That same day, during debate over the MORE Act, Rep. Earl Blumenauer wore a facemask covered in marijuana leaves on the House floor. Legality aside, it’s unbecoming for a House member to wear clothing that promotes the use of any recreational drugs on the House floor. It’s a clear violation of the House’s Code of Conduct which prohibits all behavior that does not, ‘reflect creditably on the House.'”The House passed a bill Friday that would legalize marijuana and expunge prior criminal convictions related to marijuana, in a 228-164 vote. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, introduced by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in 2019, would remove\\xa0marijuana from the schedule of controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and eliminate criminal charges for anyone who “manufactures, distributes, or possesses marijuana.” (RELATED: House Passes MORE Act, Would Legalize Marijuana)“Speaker Pelosi, you’ve allowed facemasks to be worn on the House floor that wouldn’t be allowed in a High School assembly hall. It’s unfortunate that some members can’t resist using facemasks that undermine house decorum. The best solution is likely a blanket ban on stylized facemasks,” Banks’ letter concluded.Pelosi’s office did not immediately respond the Daily Caller when asked about the letter.\"},\n",

They went under the counter and brought out about 70 or 80,000 ballots and counted those phony ballots some of them counting six and seven times.

It just amazes me that she’s under consideration.”Benjamin cited Flournoy’s support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and her support for American intervention in Syria and Libya when she served as the undersecretary of defense for policy under former President Barack Obama. Benjamin also expressed concern over Flournoy’s hawkish views towards China, which she said could lead to another cold war with a major world nuclear power.The Code Pink co-founder added that Flournoy is rife with conflicts of interests due to her work with WestExec Advisors, the consulting firm she co-founded in 2018 with Biden’s secretary of state nominee, Tony Blinken. The pair allegedly used to help corporations obtain contracts with the Pentagon. (RELATED: Biden Transition Fails To Disclose Tony Blinken’s Involvement In Lucrative Consulting And Private Equity Firms)“She is just the epitome of I think everything that’s wrong with U.S. foreign policy,” Benjamin said. “The interventionism, the militarism and the cozy nature between military contractors and the Pentagon.”Other progressive groups that are signaling opposition to Flournoy is the Bernie Sanders-founded nonprofit group Our Revolution, as well as Military Families Speak Out, Roots Action, World Beyond War and Just Foreign Policy.Flournoy has long been reported being at the top of Biden’s list to be his defense secretary, but the post was notably absent when he unveiled his national security team on Nov. 23.Politico reported in late November that six people close to Biden’s transition say the president-elect is not entirely sold on the prospect of selecting Flournoy, who was expected to have been Hillary Clinton’s selection for defense secretary had she won the presidency in 2016.Benjamin said it was an encouraging sign that Biden is taking so long to announce his defense secretary pick.“There’s division within the Biden team about this and they recognize that she is an unpopular pick within a number of groups and influential people,” Benjamin said. “Even if she does get nominated we will work hard to not have her confirmed.”US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy delivers opening remarks June 15, 2010 during a hearing conducted by the US Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. (KAREN BLEIER/AFP via Getty Images)Biden should select someone like Obama’s former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to serve as his defense secretary, Benjamin said, citing his stated position that America being embroiled in international conflicts cannot be the new normal.In addition to speaking out against a potential Flournoy nomination, Benjamin said Biden’s current national security team doesn’t inspire optimism within the progressive community.“We haven’t seen in these picks around national security issues anybody with fresh new thinking,” Benjamin said. “We think that somebody needs to come in that understands that it’s a different world and that we don’t want to go back to the way things were under Obama.”“We want to get out of these damn wars and the fact that the Democrats and Republicans in Congress come together every time Trump wants to get us out of something like Afghanistan they team up and say no,” she said. “It’s ridiculous.”“It’s really sick that the new normal is to be at war,” Benjamin said. “It should not be like that, and somebody’s got to come in who just tells it like it is and says people in the Middle East have to learn to get along with each other and we’re not going to be there as an interventionist force.”All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Trump praised Perdue and Loeffler throughout his 100-minute speech, but he also repeatedly expressed his frustration over the state’s presidential election, which he described as “rigged” and “stolen.”Some Republicans, like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Reffensperger, said that the “distractions” and “disunity” brought by Trump continuously airing his grievances over the election could ultimately harm Republicans in January. (Georgia GOP Election Official Explodes On Trump For ‘Inciting’ Violence With Rigged Election Claims)“These distractions, this disunity, it does make [the runoffs] more difficult,” Raffnesperger said on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday morning.“Yeah, sad but true … I’m a conservative Republican and I’m disappointed, but those are the results,” Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger tells @GStephanopoulos when asked if there’s no doubt in his mind that President Trump lost the state of Georgia. https://t.co/jPVBc3tTOH pic.twitter.com/R9y9BF7QE7— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) December 6, 2020 All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

       "  'full_article_text': 'John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, urged U.S. Attorney John Durham on Sunday to release an interim report on his investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, saying that the American public should have record of the investigation in case the Biden administration shuts it down.“I think the American people should know what’s happening in a two-year investigation into this and I hope that that report will be forthcoming,” Ratcliffe said in an interview on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”Attorney General William Barr appointed Durham special counsel on Oct. 19 to continue his investigation into whether government officials broke the law during the investigation of the Trump campaign.Barr’s order says that Durham must produce a final report of his investigation and that he can release interim reports before the probe is over. (RELATED: GOP Senators Say Biden’s AG Must Support Durham Probe)Some Democrats have questioned whether Durham is a duly appointed special counsel. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff noted in a Tuesday interview that the regulations for the appointment of special counsels requires that the prosecutor come from outside government.Schiff suggested that Biden’s pick for attorney general should review Durham’s investigation to consider whether to allow the investigation to remain open.“I would presume the next attorney general will look to see if there is any merit to the work that John Durham is doing and make a rational decision about whether that should continue at any level,” Schiff said in an interview on MSNBC.The California Democrat called the Durham investigation “politically motivated” and indicated that he believes it should be shut down.Barr tapped Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, on May 13, 2019, to conduct a review of the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign and other U.S. agencies’ Trump-related intelligence-gathering activities.The inquiry has since morphed into a full criminal investigation. Durham is investigating the findings of a Justice Department inspector general’s report that said the FBI misled a federal court in order to obtain warrants to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.Ratcliffe said that Schiff’s remarks show that “an interim report be appropriate.”“It would show whether or not there’s a good faith basis to continue and protect the work that’s been done,” Ratcliffe saioid. “I would encourage my colleagues over at the Department of Justice and at the FBI and in particular, special counsel Durham, to consider doing that, so that the American people can get the full accounting that they deserve.”Ratcliffe has provided hundreds of intelligence documents to Durham’s team as part of his investigation. He announced on Oct. 7 that he had sent 1,000 pages of records to the Justice Department to support the probe.Ratcliffe has also consulted with Durham regarding the declassification of FBI and intelligence documents regarding the Trump campaign and Russia.Ratcliffe, a former U.S. attorney and former member of the House Intelligence Committee, also said on Sunday that he believes that Durham should issue additional indictments in his investigation.Durham has prosecuted one case so far in the probe. Former FBI attorney Kevin Clinesmith pleaded guilty on Aug. 19 to altering an email from the CIA regarding Carter Page.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We do hundreds of millions of vaccinations a year. We’re leveraging the systems that are known and that work here in the United States.”Wallace pushed back by arguing that distribution isn’t going to go “according to the book” because of less-than-projected vaccine distribution.Azar said “tens of millions of doses of FDA-gold-standard vaccinations” will be available by the end of the year.

And ultimately the reason cynicism or ignorance or illness does not matter as much as that result.”Tapper went on to cite a song that Trump himself had repeated on the campaign trail, calling it a part of the president’s “racist campaign against immigrants.”“President Trump would often read the lyrics of a song that told the story of a tender hearted woman who finds a half-frozen snake and nurses it to health to fall victim to the snake’s predatory nature,” he explained, showing a clip of the president as he delivered the final line of the song.“‘Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in,'” Trump said.Tapper concluded by saying that Republican leaders who were concerned about Trump’s influence on the Georgia runoff elections — which will decide the balance of power in the U.S. Senate — was a result they should have foreseen.“As Republican officials deal with these horrors of a president whose hideous lies are putting their election hopes in Georgia at risk, and more importantly, tragically, unacceptably, horrifyingly, even putting lives at risk, it has to be asked, did you not know who this man was when you took him in?” Tapper asked.\"},\n",

As a former prosecutor, for over three decades, I and virtually everyone similarly situated know that DOJ guidelines do not allow comment on investigations.\\xa0They neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.”Pirro accused Barr of going “beyond that” and sharing “information on the pending investigations.”The Fox News host went on to discuss allegations of election fraud in multiple states being pursued by Trump’s legal team before essentially calling Barr a swamp creature.
